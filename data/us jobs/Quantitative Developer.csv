Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.

The Quant Analytics department at Bloomberg sits within Enterprise Products and is responsible for modeling market data, pricing, and risk calculations of financial derivatives across all asset classes. Our C++ libraries are used by all Bloomberg products and services, including the Terminal with over 300,000 clients, trading system solutions, enterprise risk management, and derivatives valuation services.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

The Quant Library Architecture (QLA) team offers the opportunity to build experience at the cutting edge of C++ and financial mathematics, engaging with and influencing a wide variety of stakeholders of differing skill sets, to deliver scalable and strategic enterprise pricing and risk solutions. QLA is a small team of C++ experts tasked with helping the Quants be as productive as possible, for the long term. We are seeking a proficient C++ developer, with a strong interest in modern software development life-cycle practices.

We'll trust you to:
• Support Quants; owning the developer experience for Quants. We build and debug C++ libraries either in VS Code remote containers in Docker, or directly on Unix hosts. Much of the infrastructure is provided by Engineering, but QLA maintain significant additional tooling to provide Quants the most powerful and usable development environment possible.
• Proactively maintain integration builds and test infrastructure. We run largely automated CI/CD builds with a wide variety of static analysis and other code quality assurance tooling. This affords not just ongoing regression testing, but also early warning of issues that might impair Quants' development environment. Rapid response and ongoing improvements to these systems are a key responsibility.
• Oversee architecture. Quants own a reasonable number of libraries interfaced into a wide variety of systems. QLA are heavily involved in API design and library architecture to meet Engineering standards whilst optimizing time to delivery, performance, and robustness. We also assess and provision 3rd party software when proven superior.
• Review code. Assisting Quants with coding best practices and improved solutions both when requested and proactively when appropriate.
• Once those Keep-The-Lights-On responsibilities are met, continue with project work as prioritized in partnership with Quants. This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

You'll need to have:
• 7+ years of full software development life-cycle experience.
• Demonstrable proficiency with C++.
• Experience designing effective APIs.
• Knowledge of Python or other scripting languages.
• Knowledge of financial products such as derivatives, interest rates, or equity markets.

We'd love to see:
• Experience mentoring and coaching other team members.
• Technical experience in some of CMake, AAD, Linux, Unix (Sun/IBM), Docker, WSL, Python, or OCaml.
• Knowledge of financial mathematics such as optimization techniques, monte-carlo, etc.
• A keen interest in developing skills in these areas.

That company was bought by a world leader in capital markets, and they moved into equities, and were successful as a prop trading shop for over 6 years, and was eventually bought as well. They are now onto their next venture they are looking to tackle the cryptocurrency market. As a trusted asset to every large financial trading desk through the years, institutions have expressed great interest in trading with them, and the firm provides crypto asset execution, trading, and advisory services to institutional clients, as well as making markets on various exchanges, as well as providing customized algorithms to split up trades. They are looking for a Quant Developer (Quant/Market maker) to join this team, and head up building the market making product. This person does not need crypto experience, but needs to understand the technical backbone of market making systems, market microstructure and the technical needs for setting up and monitoring strategies.

This opportunity is for a top notch engineer with strong quantitative skills, to take a pragmatic approach and enjoy the flexibility of building something, in an environment where there is no red tape, or barriers to your creativity. It is a great opportunity for a Quant who wants to leverage technical/math skills to learn more about, and get into trading. Ideas for strategies are encouraged, and team will help you test and implement them.

This is an opportunity for you to work with elite minds as well as trade ideas, grow in knowledge and gain exponential earnings potential. The overall climate is for everyone to make money and go home satisfied. Flexible hours and telecommuting is offered.

Qualifications

Quantitative Developer (Early Career),Manifold Technologies LLC,"Jersey City, NJ",Vaia – Talents,,"['9 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","About Us

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission. All qualified applicants will be treated with respect and receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, uniform service, veteran status, age, or any other protected characteristic per federal, state, or local law.

• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

Quant Developer/Market Maker

The Company -
Our client is a small trading shop, whose founders have an extremely successful track records in all prior ventures in high Frequency trading. The core consists of small group of educated PhD scientists who came together to build trading models in multiple asset classes over the last decade. They were first challenged to finding non-random behavior in data sets as they tackled the FX market with new algorithmic trading and quickly separated themselves from everyone else in the market. That company was bought by a world leader in capital markets, and they moved into equities, and were successful as a prop trading shop for over 6 years, and was eventually bought as well. They are now onto their next venture they are looking to tackle the cryptocurrency market. As a trusted asset to every large financial trading desk through the years, institutions have expressed great interest in trading with them, and the firm provides crypto asset execution, trading, and advisory services to institutional clients, as well as making markets on various exchanges, as well as providing customized algorithms to split up trades. They are looking for a Quant Developer (Quant/Market maker) to join this team, and head up building the market making product. This person does not need crypto experience, but needs to understand the technical backbone of market making systems, market microstructure and the technical needs for setting up and monitoring strategies.

All systems are built from scratch and brand new. The competitive advantage is the model and brilliant combination of quantitative minds. They build their systems to be smarter, highly risk averse, rigorously tested and with a strict scientific approach to modeling.

The Role
Starting as an Senior Quant Developer/Market Maker you will get a chance to get in on the ground floor in a low key environment and let data drive your decisions. This opportunity is for a top notch engineer with strong quantitative skills, to take a pragmatic approach and enjoy the flexibility of building something, in an environment where there is no red tape, or barriers to your creativity. It is a great opportunity for a Quant who wants to leverage technical/math skills to learn more about, and get into trading. Ideas for strategies are encouraged, and team will help you test and implement them.

This is an opportunity for you to work with elite minds as well as trade ideas, grow in knowledge and gain exponential earnings potential. The overall climate is for everyone to make money and go home satisfied. Flexible hours and telecommuting is offered.

Qualifications

Experience working with high performance trading systems, specifically market making systems.

FX is preferred over equity, because it translates better to the crypto-market.
Strong Java/C# Programming
Ability to develop systematic models from a mathematical approach

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

VisualHFT is an advanced analytics platform purpose-built for high-frequency trading environments. Designed for traders, quants, and financial engineers, we provide deep insights into execution quality, market microstructure, and real-time system performance — down to the microsecond.

As a pre-MVP, pre-revenue startup, we are crafting a precision toolset for modern electronic trading. We're building a platform that bridges HPC engineering with quantitative finance research, and this hire will be key to that effort.

What We’re Looking For

We’re seeking a Quantitative Developer who combines deep market microstructure expertise with a strong foundation in real-time, low-latency system design. This is a hands-on, equity-only role focused on translating quantitative models and financial research into performant, actionable tools for traders.

As an early team member, you'll own the architecture and implementation of real-time metrics, indicators, and diagnostics at the heart of VisualHFT.

What We’re Looking For
• Deep understanding of market microstructure and electronic trading mechanics
• Strong experience in real-time or low-latency systems (C#, C++, or Rust preferred)
• Proven work in HPC optimization: parallelization, memory layout tuning, zero-GC systems
• Hands-on experience with financial research implementation (execution cost models, order flow analytics)
• Comfortable with modular, plugin-based system architectures and high-throughput data pipelines

🌟 Bonus Points
• Experience in an HFT, market-making, or algo execution environment
• Familiarity with ITCH/FIX/OUCH protocols and exchange-specific microstructure behaviors
• Understanding of infrastructure monitoring in trading systems (latency breakdowns, tick-to-trade analysis)
• Exposure to quantitative strategy simulation and live production systems

What We Offer
• Equity: 1.5%–2.0% equity with a 4-year vesting schedule (1-year cliff)
• Technical Leadership: Core contributor to the logic powering VisualHFT’s analytics engine
• Impact: Your work will be the foundation of VisualHFT’s edge in execution analytics and trading diagnostics

Quantitative Developer - C++ Infrastructure for Quant Analytics,Bloomberg,Anywhere,ZipRecruiter,,"['1 month ago', 'Work from home', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned', 'Health insurance', 'Paid time off', 'Dental insurance']","Description & Requirements

The Quant Analytics department at Bloomberg sits within Enterprise Products and is responsible for modeling market data, pricing, and risk calculations of financial derivatives across all asset classes. Our C++ libraries are used by all Bloomberg products and services, including the Terminal with over 300,000 clients, trading system solutions, enterprise risk management, and derivatives valuation services.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

The Quant Library Architecture (QLA) team offers the opportunity to build experience at the cutting edge of C++ and financial mathematics, engaging with and influencing a wide variety of stakeholders of differing skill sets, to deliver scalable and strategic enterprise pricing and risk solutions. QLA is a small team of C++ experts tasked with helping the Quants be as productive as possible, for the long term. We are seeking a proficient C++ developer, with a strong interest in modern software development life-cycle practices.

We'll trust you to:
• Support Quants; owning the developer experience for Quants. We build and debug C++ libraries either in VS Code remote containers in Docker, or directly on Unix hosts. Much of the infrastructure is provided by Engineering, but QLA maintain significant additional tooling to provide Quants the most powerful and usable development environment possible.
• Proactively maintain integration builds and test infrastructure. We run largely automated CI/CD builds with a wide variety of static analysis and other code quality assurance tooling. This affords not just ongoing regression testing, but also early warning of issues that might impair Quants' development environment. Rapid response and ongoing improvements to these systems are a key responsibility.
• Oversee architecture. Quants own a reasonable number of libraries interfaced into a wide variety of systems. QLA are heavily involved in API design and library architecture to meet Engineering standards whilst optimizing time to delivery, performance, and robustness. We also assess and provision 3rd party software when proven superior.
• Review code. Assisting Quants with coding best practices and improved solutions both when requested and proactively when appropriate.
• Once those Keep-The-Lights-On responsibilities are met, continue with project work as prioritized in partnership with Quants. This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

You'll need to have:
• 7+ years of full software development life-cycle experience.
• Demonstrable proficiency with C++.
• Experience designing effective APIs.
• Knowledge of Python or other scripting languages.
• Knowledge of financial products such as derivatives, interest rates, or equity markets.

We'd love to see:
• Experience mentoring and coaching other team members.
• Technical experience in some of CMake, AAD, Linux, Unix (Sun/IBM), Docker, WSL, Python, or OCaml.
• Knowledge of financial mathematics such as optimization techniques, monte-carlo, etc.
• A keen interest in developing skills in these areas.

Quantitative Developer (Early Career),Manifold Technologies LLC,"Jersey City, NJ",Vaia – Talents,,"['9 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","About Us

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.

Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design.

• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Quantitative Developer - C++ Infrastructure for Quant Analytics,Bloomberg,Anywhere,ZipRecruiter,,"['1 month ago', 'Work from home', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned', 'Health insurance', 'Paid time off', 'Dental insurance']","Description & Requirements

The Quant Analytics department at Bloomberg sits within Enterprise Products and is responsible for modeling market data, pricing, and risk calculations of financial derivatives across all asset classes. Our C++ libraries are used by all Bloomberg products and services, including the Terminal with over 300,000 clients, trading system solutions, enterprise risk management, and derivatives valuation services.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

The Quant Library Architecture (QLA) team offers the opportunity to build experience at the cutting edge of C++ and financial mathematics, engaging with and influencing a wide variety of stakeholders of differing skill sets, to deliver scalable and strategic enterprise pricing and risk solutions. QLA is a small team of C++ experts tasked with helping the Quants be as productive as possible, for the long term. We are seeking a proficient C++ developer, with a strong interest in modern software development life-cycle practices.

We'll trust you to:
• Support Quants; owning the developer experience for Quants. We build and debug C++ libraries either in VS Code remote containers in Docker, or directly on Unix hosts. Much of the infrastructure is provided by Engineering, but QLA maintain significant additional tooling to provide Quants the most powerful and usable development environment possible.
• Proactively maintain integration builds and test infrastructure. We run largely automated CI/CD builds with a wide variety of static analysis and other code quality assurance tooling. This affords not just ongoing regression testing, but also early warning of issues that might impair Quants' development environment. Rapid response and ongoing improvements to these systems are a key responsibility.
• Oversee architecture. Quants own a reasonable number of libraries interfaced into a wide variety of systems. QLA are heavily involved in API design and library architecture to meet Engineering standards whilst optimizing time to delivery, performance, and robustness. We also assess and provision 3rd party software when proven superior.
• Review code. Assisting Quants with coding best practices and improved solutions both when requested and proactively when appropriate.
• Once those Keep-The-Lights-On responsibilities are met, continue with project work as prioritized in partnership with Quants. This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

You'll need to have:
• 7+ years of full software development life-cycle experience.
• Demonstrable proficiency with C++.
• Experience designing effective APIs.
• Knowledge of Python or other scripting languages.
• Knowledge of financial products such as derivatives, interest rates, or equity markets.

We'd love to see:
• Experience mentoring and coaching other team members.
• Technical experience in some of CMake, AAD, Linux, Unix (Sun/IBM), Docker, WSL, Python, or OCaml.
• Knowledge of financial mathematics such as optimization techniques, monte-carlo, etc.
• A keen interest in developing skills in these areas.

Quant Developer/Market Maker

The Company -
Our client is a small trading shop, whose founders have an extremely successful track records in all prior ventures in high Frequency trading. The core consists of small group of educated PhD scientists who came together to build trading models in multiple asset classes over the last decade. They were first challenged to finding non-random behavior in data sets as they tackled the FX market with new algorithmic trading and quickly separated themselves from everyone else in the market. That company was bought by a world leader in capital markets, and they moved into equities, and were successful as a prop trading shop for over 6 years, and was eventually bought as well. They are now onto their next venture they are looking to tackle the cryptocurrency market. As a trusted asset to every large financial trading desk through the years, institutions have expressed great interest in trading with them, and the firm provides crypto asset execution, trading, and advisory services to institutional clients, as well as making markets on various exchanges, as well as providing customized algorithms to split up trades. They are looking for a Quant Developer (Quant/Market maker) to join this team, and head up building the market making product. This person does not need crypto experience, but needs to understand the technical backbone of market making systems, market microstructure and the technical needs for setting up and monitoring strategies.

All systems are built from scratch and brand new. The competitive advantage is the model and brilliant combination of quantitative minds. They build their systems to be smarter, highly risk averse, rigorously tested and with a strict scientific approach to modeling.

The Role

This opportunity is for a top notch engineer with strong quantitative skills, to take a pragmatic approach and enjoy the flexibility of building something, in an environment where there is no red tape, or barriers to your creativity. It is a great opportunity for a Quant who wants to leverage technical/math skills to learn more about, and get into trading. Ideas for strategies are encouraged, and team will help you test and implement them.

This is an opportunity for you to work with elite minds as well as trade ideas, grow in knowledge and gain exponential earnings potential. The overall climate is for everyone to make money and go home satisfied. Flexible hours and telecommuting is offered.

Qualifications

Experience working with high performance trading systems, specifically market making systems.

Quantitative Developer (Early Career),Manifold Technologies LLC,"Jersey City, NJ",Vaia – Talents,,"['9 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","About Us

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

This affords not just ongoing regression testing, but also early warning of issues that might impair Quants' development environment. Rapid response and ongoing improvements to these systems are a key responsibility.
• Oversee architecture. Quants own a reasonable number of libraries interfaced into a wide variety of systems. QLA are heavily involved in API design and library architecture to meet Engineering standards whilst optimizing time to delivery, performance, and robustness. We also assess and provision 3rd party software when proven superior.
• Review code. Assisting Quants with coding best practices and improved solutions both when requested and proactively when appropriate.
• Once those Keep-The-Lights-On responsibilities are met, continue with project work as prioritized in partnership with Quants. This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

You'll need to have:
• 7+ years of full software development life-cycle experience.
• Demonstrable proficiency with C++.
• Experience designing effective APIs.
• Knowledge of Python or other scripting languages.
• Knowledge of financial products such as derivatives, interest rates, or equity markets.

We'd love to see:
• Experience mentoring and coaching other team members.
• Technical experience in some of CMake, AAD, Linux, Unix (Sun/IBM), Docker, WSL, Python, or OCaml.
• Knowledge of financial mathematics such as optimization techniques, monte-carlo, etc.
• A keen interest in developing skills in these areas.

The Company -
Our client is a small trading shop, whose founders have an extremely successful track records in all prior ventures in high Frequency trading. The core consists of small group of educated PhD scientists who came together to build trading models in multiple asset classes over the last decade. They were first challenged to finding non-random behavior in data sets as they tackled the FX market with new algorithmic trading and quickly separated themselves from everyone else in the market. That company was bought by a world leader in capital markets, and they moved into equities, and were successful as a prop trading shop for over 6 years, and was eventually bought as well. They are now onto their next venture they are looking to tackle the cryptocurrency market. As a trusted asset to every large financial trading desk through the years, institutions have expressed great interest in trading with them, and the firm provides crypto asset execution, trading, and advisory services to institutional clients, as well as making markets on various exchanges, as well as providing customized algorithms to split up trades. They are looking for a Quant Developer (Quant/Market maker) to join this team, and head up building the market making product. This person does not need crypto experience, but needs to understand the technical backbone of market making systems, market microstructure and the technical needs for setting up and monitoring strategies.

All systems are built from scratch and brand new. The competitive advantage is the model and brilliant combination of quantitative minds. They build their systems to be smarter, highly risk averse, rigorously tested and with a strict scientific approach to modeling.

This opportunity is for a top notch engineer with strong quantitative skills, to take a pragmatic approach and enjoy the flexibility of building something, in an environment where there is no red tape, or barriers to your creativity. It is a great opportunity for a Quant who wants to leverage technical/math skills to learn more about, and get into trading. Ideas for strategies are encouraged, and team will help you test and implement them.

This is an opportunity for you to work with elite minds as well as trade ideas, grow in knowledge and gain exponential earnings potential. The overall climate is for everyone to make money and go home satisfied. Flexible hours and telecommuting is offered.

Qualifications
