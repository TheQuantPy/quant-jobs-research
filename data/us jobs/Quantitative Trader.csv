We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:

• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission.

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

We truly believe in the power that comes from the diverse backgrounds and experiences our employees bring with them. Although each vacancy details what we are looking for, we don't necessarily need you to fulfil all of them when applying. If you like change and innovation, seek to see the bigger picture, make data driven decisions and are a good team player, you could be a great fit.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission. All qualified applicants will be treated with respect and receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, uniform service, veteran status, age, or any other protected characteristic per federal, state, or local law.

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Kalshi has defined a new category: prediction markets. Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history. Kalshi is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.

We believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.
• Our vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.
• Our mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.

Building a new category is hard… like really hard. But it’s beautiful and deeply fulfilling. Our culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.
Role Roadmap

Kalshi Trading is the market-making arm of Kalshi. It aims to provide liquidity to all the markets in the Kalshi Exchange, as well as price them efficiently. As an Engineer, you will be responsible for planning, building and maintaining autonomous systems that execute and support our market making strategies on the Kalshi Exchange. We are looking for someone with 3-7 years of experience building distributed and performance engineering systems as well as a strong understanding of theoretical trading system design. We're scaling, which means your role will evolve and grow with the company; your initial attack threads include:
• Deal with large betting and sports datasets
• Building sports forecasting models using game data
• Using bookmaker odds data in conjunction with original modeling to generate prices
• Programming ability required (Python, R, or similar languages for statistical modeling)
• Experience working in the sports or betting industries preferred
• Building autonomous systems that will dynamically allocate liquidity on the Kalshi Exchange, based on the outputs from the forecasting models and algorithms
• Working on performance and ensuring the systems are operating reliably and with low latency
• Retrieving, organizing, storing and exposing data from the Kalshi Exchange as well as from a variety of external data sources
• Working with the research team to implement the forecasting models and algorithms they develop in scalable and efficient ways
• Maintaining an organized record of all of the trades executed by the market maker

The rest of what the role looks like is up to you - a big part of our approach is that you get to chart your path as we grow and evolve. You will have a lot of influence in shaping what both your role and the activity of Kalshi Trading look like as we grow. There's a lot of green field to conquer, we trust that you'll make a lot of it your own :)
Our Culture

Meritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.

Kalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.

Commitment to Equal Opportunity

Kalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission. All qualified applicants will be treated with respect and receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, uniform service, veteran status, age, or any other protected characteristic per federal, state, or local law.
