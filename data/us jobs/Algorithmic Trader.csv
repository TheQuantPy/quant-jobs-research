The Quant Analytics department at Bloomberg sits within Enterprise Products and is responsible for modeling market data, pricing, and risk calculations of financial derivatives across all asset classes. Our C++ libraries are used by all Bloomberg products and services, including the Terminal with over 300,000 clients, trading system solutions, enterprise risk management, and derivatives valuation services.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

The Quant Library Architecture (QLA) team offers the opportunity to build experience at the cutting edge of C++ and financial mathematics, engaging with and influencing a wide variety of stakeholders of differing skill sets, to deliver scalable and strategic enterprise pricing and risk solutions.

We are seeking a proficient C++ developer, with a strong interest in modern software development life-cycle practices.

We'll trust you to:
• Support Quants; owning the developer experience for Quants. We build and debug C++ libraries either in VS Code remote containers in Docker, or directly on Unix hosts.

• Proactively maintain integration builds and test infrastructure. We run largely automated CI/CD builds with a wide variety of static analysis and other code quality assurance tooling. This affords not just ongoing regression testing, but also early warning of issues that might impair Quants' development environment. Rapid response and ongoing improvements to these systems are a key responsibility.
• Oversee architecture. Quants own a reasonable number of libraries interfaced into a wide variety of systems. QLA are heavily involved in API design and library architecture to meet Engineering standards whilst optimizing time to delivery, performance, and robustness. We also assess and provision 3rd party software when proven superior.
• Review code. Assisting Quants with coding best practices and improved solutions both when requested and proactively when appropriate.
• Once those Keep-The-Lights-On responsibilities are met, continue with project work as prioritized in partnership with Quants. This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

You'll need to have:
• 7+ years of full software development life-cycle experience.
• Demonstrable proficiency with C++.
• Experience designing effective APIs.
• Knowledge of Python or other scripting languages.
• Knowledge of financial products such as derivatives, interest rates, or equity markets.

We'd love to see:
• Experience mentoring and coaching other team members.
• Technical experience in some of CMake, AAD, Linux, Unix (Sun/IBM), Docker, WSL, Python, or OCaml.
• Knowledge of financial mathematics such as optimization techniques, monte-carlo, etc.
• A keen interest in developing skills in these areas.

Our goal is to empower traders by showing them how to translate their trading ideas into functional, backtested algorithms.

We're seeking a talented and innovative developer who is an expert in both PineScript and utilizing AI/LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) for code generation and strategy development. You will be a core part of our mission, not only developing PineScript trading algorithms but also meticulously documenting your AI-assisted development process to assist in the creation of educational content for our community.

The ideal candidate will help us demonstrate how AI can be used to build PineScript strategies from scratch, from initial concept to a profitably backtested algorithm ready for deployment and automation (e.g., via webhooks to services like Traders Post).

This is a long-term, part-time opportunity for someone passionate about the intersection of AI, trading, and education.

Responsibilities:

- Utilize AI/LLM tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to generate, test, and refine PineScript trading algorithms and indicators.

- Develop 1-3 PineScript trading strategies with demonstrably profitable backtests within the first 30 days.

- Thoroughly document your entire development process and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), emphasizing how AI was used at each step. This documentation will serve as educational material for our community.

- Collaborate on creating a clear, replicable system for community members to follow when building their own AI-assisted PineScript strategies.

- Integrate developed PineScript strategies with TradingView and prepare them for webhook automation.

- Debug and optimize PineScript code for performance and accuracy.

Required Skills & Experience:

- Proven expertise in PineScript development: Ability to write complex trading strategies and indicators in PineScript manually (without AI assistance). Please provide examples or a portfolio of your PineScript work.

- Demonstrable experience using AI/LLMs for code generation and problem-solving (e.g., using tools like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Cursor to generate or assist with PineScript or other code).

- Strong understanding of technical analysis, trading concepts, and strategy backtesting methodologies.

- Ability to systematically document processes and create clear, replicable SOPs.

- Excellent communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts simply.

- Self-motivated and able to work independently to meet deadlines.

The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing a robust trading strategy, writing the necessary code, and ensuring seamless implementation. Strong knowledge of futures trading, market analysis, and Rithmic's API is essential. If you have a proven track record in algorithmic trading and can deliver actionable insights, we would love to hear from you.

Develop Automated Commodity Futures Trading Bot (Rithmic & Tradovate) with Advanced Risk Management

Project Overview:

I'm looking for an expert programmer to build an automated trading system for commodity futures. The system must integrate with Rithmic (for market data/order execution, via R | API+ or R | Protocol API) and Tradovate (for brokerage).

The strategy will focus on liquid US commodity futures (energies, metals, grains), aiming to capture significant, longer-term price movements (e.g., 150-800 ticks per trade) rather than high-frequency scalping. This is a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing steady, consistent performance.

Crucially, the system must operate under a strict $1000 maximum static account drawdown. This requires exceptional risk management. AI/ML integration for strategy enhancement is a potential Phase 2 interest.

Key Technical Requirements:

API Integration: Seamless and robust connection to Rithmic (data/orders) and Tradovate (account info).

Trading Strategy: Implement a configurable strategy (e.g., trend-following or breakout) for a basket of commodities.

Risk Management (Paramount):

Absolute adherence to the $1000 max drawdown.

ATR-based position sizing.

User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 0.5%-1% of effective capital).

Automated stop-loss orders for every trade.

Core Operations: Comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and API reconnection logic.

Language: Python preferred; C++/C# considered if justified for Rithmic.

Deliverables:

Fully functional, well-documented source code for the trading bot.

Clear setup, configuration, and operation instructions.

Assistance with initial simulated and live deployment/testing.

Essential Skills & Experience:

Mandatory: Proven experience with Rithmic API and Tradovate API.

Strong proficiency in Python (preferred), C++, or C#.

Deep understanding of commodity futures trading, order types, and execution.

Expertise in implementing sophisticated risk management and position sizing algorithms (especially ATR-based) within tight drawdown limits.

Ability to write clean, reliable, and well-documented code.

Experience with backtesting methodologies is a strong plus.

AI/ML skills applicable to trading are desirable for potential future work.

"Specialized eFX AI Trading Quant, Vice President",2004 SSB&T CO - UK BRANCH,"Boston, MA",ZipRecruiter,,"['5 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","Who we are looking for

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

We truly believe in the power that comes from the diverse backgrounds and experiences our employees bring with them. Although each vacancy details what we are looking for, we don't necessarily need you to fulfil all of them when applying. If you like change and innovation, seek to see the bigger picture, make data driven decisions and are a good team player, you could be a great fit.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

The ideal candidate will help us demonstrate how AI can be used to build PineScript strategies from scratch, from initial concept to a profitably backtested algorithm ready for deployment and automation (e.g., via webhooks to services like Traders Post).

This is a long-term, part-time opportunity for someone passionate about the intersection of AI, trading, and education.

Responsibilities:

- Utilize AI/LLM tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to generate, test, and refine PineScript trading algorithms and indicators.

- Develop 1-3 PineScript trading strategies with demonstrably profitable backtests within the first 30 days.

- Thoroughly document your entire development process and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), emphasizing how AI was used at each step. This documentation will serve as educational material for our community.

- Collaborate on creating a clear, replicable system for community members to follow when building their own AI-assisted PineScript strategies.

- Integrate developed PineScript strategies with TradingView and prepare them for webhook automation.

- Debug and optimize PineScript code for performance and accuracy.

Required Skills & Experience:

- Proven expertise in PineScript development: Ability to write complex trading strategies and indicators in PineScript manually (without AI assistance). Please provide examples or a portfolio of your PineScript work.

- Demonstrable experience using AI/LLMs for code generation and problem-solving (e.g., using tools like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Cursor to generate or assist with PineScript or other code).

- Strong understanding of technical analysis, trading concepts, and strategy backtesting methodologies.

- Ability to systematically document processes and create clear, replicable SOPs.

- Excellent communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts simply.

- Self-motivated and able to work independently to meet deadlines.

Preferred Qualifications (Bonus Points):

- You already have existing PineScript strategies with a track record of profitable backtests that you can showcase (and ideally, demonstrate how AI could have been used or was used in their creation/refinement).

- Experience with webhook integrations for trading automation (e.g., Traders Post, 3Commas).

- Familiarity with creating educational content (written or video).

- Interest in agentic workflows and AI automations for agentic TA/FA analysis (this is a secondary, future goal).

To Apply:

Please submit your proposal and include:

1. A brief introduction highlighting your experience with PineScript and AI tools for code generation.

2. Examples of PineScript projects you have completed.

3. Describe your experience using AI (like Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.) to assist in coding or strategy development. If possible, provide a specific example.

4. Confirm your availability for part-time, long-term work and your acceptance or alternative offer of the proposed hourly rate.

5. (Optional) If you have existing profitable PineScript strategies, please mention them.

Commodity Futures Trading Strategy Development with Rithmic,Upwork,Anywhere,Upwork,,"['20 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Contractor', 'No degree mentioned']","We are seeking an experienced trader or developer to set up a commodity futures trading system using Rithmic in collaboration with a proprietary trading firm. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing a robust trading strategy, writing the necessary code, and ensuring seamless implementation. Strong knowledge of futures trading, market analysis, and Rithmic's API is essential. If you have a proven track record in algorithmic trading and can deliver actionable insights, we would love to hear from you.

Develop Automated Commodity Futures Trading Bot (Rithmic & Tradovate) with Advanced Risk Management

Project Overview:

I'm looking for an expert programmer to build an automated trading system for commodity futures. The system must integrate with Rithmic (for market data/order execution, via R | API+ or R | Protocol API) and Tradovate (for brokerage).

The strategy will focus on liquid US commodity futures (energies, metals, grains), aiming to capture significant, longer-term price movements (e.g., 150-800 ticks per trade) rather than high-frequency scalping. This is a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing steady, consistent performance.

Crucially, the system must operate under a strict $1000 maximum static account drawdown. This requires exceptional risk management. AI/ML integration for strategy enhancement is a potential Phase 2 interest.

Key Technical Requirements:

API Integration: Seamless and robust connection to Rithmic (data/orders) and Tradovate (account info).

Trading Strategy: Implement a configurable strategy (e.g., trend-following or breakout) for a basket of commodities.

Risk Management (Paramount):

Absolute adherence to the $1000 max drawdown.

ATR-based position sizing.

User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 0.5%-1% of effective capital).

Automated stop-loss orders for every trade.

Core Operations: Comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and API reconnection logic.

Language: Python preferred; C++/C# considered if justified for Rithmic.

Deliverables:

Fully functional, well-documented source code for the trading bot.

Clear setup, configuration, and operation instructions.

Assistance with initial simulated and live deployment/testing.

Essential Skills & Experience:

Mandatory: Proven experience with Rithmic API and Tradovate API.

Strong proficiency in Python (preferred), C++, or C#.

Deep understanding of commodity futures trading, order types, and execution.

Expertise in implementing sophisticated risk management and position sizing algorithms (especially ATR-based) within tight drawdown limits.

Ability to write clean, reliable, and well-documented code.

Experience with backtesting methodologies is a strong plus.

AI/ML skills applicable to trading are desirable for potential future work.

To Apply, Please Provide:

Specific details of your experience with Rithmic and Tradovate APIs.

Examples of similar automated trading systems you’ve built.

Your approach to implementing robust risk management under tight drawdown constraints.

Estimated timeline and bid for this core system.

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Commodity Futures Trading Strategy Development with Rithmic,Upwork,Anywhere,Upwork,,"['20 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Contractor', 'No degree mentioned']","We are seeking an experienced trader or developer to set up a commodity futures trading system using Rithmic in collaboration with a proprietary trading firm. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing a robust trading strategy, writing the necessary code, and ensuring seamless implementation. Strong knowledge of futures trading, market analysis, and Rithmic's API is essential. If you have a proven track record in algorithmic trading and can deliver actionable insights, we would love to hear from you.

Develop Automated Commodity Futures Trading Bot (Rithmic & Tradovate) with Advanced Risk Management

Project Overview:

I'm looking for an expert programmer to build an automated trading system for commodity futures. The system must integrate with Rithmic (for market data/order execution, via R | API+ or R | Protocol API) and Tradovate (for brokerage).

The strategy will focus on liquid US commodity futures (energies, metals, grains), aiming to capture significant, longer-term price movements (e.g., 150-800 ticks per trade) rather than high-frequency scalping. This is a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing steady, consistent performance.

Crucially, the system must operate under a strict $1000 maximum static account drawdown. This requires exceptional risk management. AI/ML integration for strategy enhancement is a potential Phase 2 interest.

Key Technical Requirements:

API Integration: Seamless and robust connection to Rithmic (data/orders) and Tradovate (account info).

Trading Strategy: Implement a configurable strategy (e.g., trend-following or breakout) for a basket of commodities.

Risk Management (Paramount):

Absolute adherence to the $1000 max drawdown.

ATR-based position sizing.

User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 0.5%-1% of effective capital).

Automated stop-loss orders for every trade.

Core Operations: Comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and API reconnection logic.

Language: Python preferred; C++/C# considered if justified for Rithmic.

Deliverables:

Fully functional, well-documented source code for the trading bot.

Clear setup, configuration, and operation instructions.

Assistance with initial simulated and live deployment/testing.

Essential Skills & Experience:

Mandatory: Proven experience with Rithmic API and Tradovate API.

Strong proficiency in Python (preferred), C++, or C#.

Deep understanding of commodity futures trading, order types, and execution.

Expertise in implementing sophisticated risk management and position sizing algorithms (especially ATR-based) within tight drawdown limits.

Ability to write clean, reliable, and well-documented code.

Experience with backtesting methodologies is a strong plus.

AI/ML skills applicable to trading are desirable for potential future work.

To Apply, Please Provide:

Specific details of your experience with Rithmic and Tradovate APIs.

Examples of similar automated trading systems you’ve built.

Your approach to implementing robust risk management under tight drawdown constraints.

Estimated timeline and bid for this core system.

- Collaborate on creating a clear, replicable system for community members to follow when building their own AI-assisted PineScript strategies.

- Integrate developed PineScript strategies with TradingView and prepare them for webhook automation.

- Debug and optimize PineScript code for performance and accuracy.

Required Skills & Experience:

- Proven expertise in PineScript development: Ability to write complex trading strategies and indicators in PineScript manually (without AI assistance). Please provide examples or a portfolio of your PineScript work.

"Specialized eFX AI Trading Quant, Vice President",2004 SSB&T CO - UK BRANCH,"Boston, MA",ZipRecruiter,,"['5 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","Who we are looking for

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

We truly believe in the power that comes from the diverse backgrounds and experiences our employees bring with them. Although each vacancy details what we are looking for, we don't necessarily need you to fulfil all of them when applying. If you like change and innovation, seek to see the bigger picture, make data driven decisions and are a good team player, you could be a great fit.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

This might be longer term improvements related to the above, development work on infrastructural components (such as the interfacing and orchestration library layers), performance tuning, or deeper engagement with Quant projects.
• Proactively engage stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds.
• Understand, document and communicate sometimes quite complex requirements.
• Context switch between strategic projects and urgent support requests.
• Clearly and concisely communicate a strategy, adapting communication to suit the audience and their concerns.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

Our goal is to empower traders by showing them how to translate their trading ideas into functional, backtested algorithms.

We're seeking a talented and innovative developer who is an expert in both PineScript and utilizing AI/LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) for code generation and strategy development. You will be a core part of our mission, not only developing PineScript trading algorithms but also meticulously documenting your AI-assisted development process to assist in the creation of educational content for our community.

This is a long-term, part-time opportunity for someone passionate about the intersection of AI, trading, and education.

Responsibilities:

- Utilize AI/LLM tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to generate, test, and refine PineScript trading algorithms and indicators.

- Develop 1-3 PineScript trading strategies with demonstrably profitable backtests within the first 30 days.

- Thoroughly document your entire development process and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), emphasizing how AI was used at each step. This documentation will serve as educational material for our community.

- Collaborate on creating a clear, replicable system for community members to follow when building their own AI-assisted PineScript strategies.

- Integrate developed PineScript strategies with TradingView and prepare them for webhook automation.

- Debug and optimize PineScript code for performance and accuracy.

Required Skills & Experience:

- Proven expertise in PineScript development: Ability to write complex trading strategies and indicators in PineScript manually (without AI assistance). Please provide examples or a portfolio of your PineScript work.

- Demonstrable experience using AI/LLMs for code generation and problem-solving (e.g., using tools like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Cursor to generate or assist with PineScript or other code).

- Strong understanding of technical analysis, trading concepts, and strategy backtesting methodologies.

- Ability to systematically document processes and create clear, replicable SOPs.

- Excellent communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts simply.

- Self-motivated and able to work independently to meet deadlines.

Preferred Qualifications (Bonus Points):

- You already have existing PineScript strategies with a track record of profitable backtests that you can showcase (and ideally, demonstrate how AI could have been used or was used in their creation/refinement).

- Experience with webhook integrations for trading automation (e.g., Traders Post, 3Commas).

- Familiarity with creating educational content (written or video).

- Interest in agentic workflows and AI automations for agentic TA/FA analysis (this is a secondary, future goal).

To Apply:

Please submit your proposal and include:

1. A brief introduction highlighting your experience with PineScript and AI tools for code generation.

2. Examples of PineScript projects you have completed.

3. Describe your experience using AI (like Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.) to assist in coding or strategy development. If possible, provide a specific example.

4. Confirm your availability for part-time, long-term work and your acceptance or alternative offer of the proposed hourly rate.

Commodity Futures Trading Strategy Development with Rithmic,Upwork,Anywhere,Upwork,,"['20 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Contractor', 'No degree mentioned']","We are seeking an experienced trader or developer to set up a commodity futures trading system using Rithmic in collaboration with a proprietary trading firm. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing a robust trading strategy, writing the necessary code, and ensuring seamless implementation. Strong knowledge of futures trading, market analysis, and Rithmic's API is essential. If you have a proven track record in algorithmic trading and can deliver actionable insights, we would love to hear from you.

Develop Automated Commodity Futures Trading Bot (Rithmic & Tradovate) with Advanced Risk Management

Project Overview:

I'm looking for an expert programmer to build an automated trading system for commodity futures. The system must integrate with Rithmic (for market data/order execution, via R | API+ or R | Protocol API) and Tradovate (for brokerage).

The strategy will focus on liquid US commodity futures (energies, metals, grains), aiming to capture significant, longer-term price movements (e.g., 150-800 ticks per trade) rather than high-frequency scalping. This is a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing steady, consistent performance.

Crucially, the system must operate under a strict $1000 maximum static account drawdown. This requires exceptional risk management. AI/ML integration for strategy enhancement is a potential Phase 2 interest.

Key Technical Requirements:

API Integration: Seamless and robust connection to Rithmic (data/orders) and Tradovate (account info).

Trading Strategy: Implement a configurable strategy (e.g., trend-following or breakout) for a basket of commodities.

Risk Management (Paramount):

Absolute adherence to the $1000 max drawdown.

ATR-based position sizing.

User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 0.5%-1% of effective capital).

Automated stop-loss orders for every trade.

Core Operations: Comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and API reconnection logic.

Language: Python preferred; C++/C# considered if justified for Rithmic.

Deliverables:

Fully functional, well-documented source code for the trading bot.

Clear setup, configuration, and operation instructions.

Assistance with initial simulated and live deployment/testing.

Essential Skills & Experience:

Mandatory: Proven experience with Rithmic API and Tradovate API.

Strong proficiency in Python (preferred), C++, or C#.

Deep understanding of commodity futures trading, order types, and execution.

Expertise in implementing sophisticated risk management and position sizing algorithms (especially ATR-based) within tight drawdown limits.

Ability to write clean, reliable, and well-documented code.

Experience with backtesting methodologies is a strong plus.

AI/ML skills applicable to trading are desirable for potential future work.

To Apply, Please Provide:

Specific details of your experience with Rithmic and Tradovate APIs.

Examples of similar automated trading systems you’ve built.

Your approach to implementing robust risk management under tight drawdown constraints.

Estimated timeline and bid for this core system.

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Commodity Futures Trading Strategy Development with Rithmic,Upwork,Anywhere,Upwork,,"['20 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Contractor', 'No degree mentioned']","We are seeking an experienced trader or developer to set up a commodity futures trading system using Rithmic in collaboration with a proprietary trading firm. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing a robust trading strategy, writing the necessary code, and ensuring seamless implementation. Strong knowledge of futures trading, market analysis, and Rithmic's API is essential. If you have a proven track record in algorithmic trading and can deliver actionable insights, we would love to hear from you.

Develop Automated Commodity Futures Trading Bot (Rithmic & Tradovate) with Advanced Risk Management

Project Overview:

I'm looking for an expert programmer to build an automated trading system for commodity futures. The system must integrate with Rithmic (for market data/order execution, via R | API+ or R | Protocol API) and Tradovate (for brokerage).

The strategy will focus on liquid US commodity futures (energies, metals, grains), aiming to capture significant, longer-term price movements (e.g., 150-800 ticks per trade) rather than high-frequency scalping. This is a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing steady, consistent performance.

Crucially, the system must operate under a strict $1000 maximum static account drawdown. This requires exceptional risk management. AI/ML integration for strategy enhancement is a potential Phase 2 interest.

Key Technical Requirements:

API Integration: Seamless and robust connection to Rithmic (data/orders) and Tradovate (account info).

Trading Strategy: Implement a configurable strategy (e.g., trend-following or breakout) for a basket of commodities.

Risk Management (Paramount):

Absolute adherence to the $1000 max drawdown.

ATR-based position sizing.

User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 0.5%-1% of effective capital).

Automated stop-loss orders for every trade.

Core Operations: Comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and API reconnection logic.

Language: Python preferred; C++/C# considered if justified for Rithmic.

Deliverables:

Fully functional, well-documented source code for the trading bot.

Clear setup, configuration, and operation instructions.

Assistance with initial simulated and live deployment/testing.

Essential Skills & Experience:

Mandatory: Proven experience with Rithmic API and Tradovate API.

Strong proficiency in Python (preferred), C++, or C#.

Deep understanding of commodity futures trading, order types, and execution.

Expertise in implementing sophisticated risk management and position sizing algorithms (especially ATR-based) within tight drawdown limits.

"Specialized eFX AI Trading Quant, Vice President",2004 SSB&T CO - UK BRANCH,"Boston, MA",ZipRecruiter,,"['5 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","Who we are looking for

This is one of two identical front office, trading floor roles with the eFX Quant Trading team. We're a friendly, collaborative, multi-disciplinary team, with diverse trading strategies across spot FX, NDFs, and swaps. The ideal people for these roles have eFX modelling experience and practical experience with applying neural nets to time series modelling.

People who lack eFX experience, but have several years of real-world experience applying neural nets to time series in any industry, or as the focus of a research degree or post-doc, are strongly encouraged to apply. Similarly people with solid quant trading experience (in FX, cash equities, or futures) and practical experience with machine learning techniques are also strongly encouraged.

The roles are for the London office, but being based in the Boston office instead is a possibility.

These roles can be performed in a hybrid model, where you can balance work from home and office to match your needs and role requirements.

Why this role is important to us

The team you will be joining is a part of State Street Global Markets (SSGM). When owners and managers of institutional assets need research, trading, securities lending and innovative portfolio strategies, they turn to SSGM business unit. As our investment research and trading arm, SSGM's number one goal is to enhance and preserve our clients' portfolio values by applying technology, optimizing trading, and linking asset classes and markets across the world.

Join us if making your mark in the capital markets industry from day one is a challenge you are up for.

What you will be responsible for

As an eFX AI Quant Trader you will:
• Create profitable and robust trading signals, strategies, and models to make a significant contribution to P&L targets and eFX growth
• Apply your experience with time series AI to try to solve some of our most challenging problems
• Tackle modelling and analysis challenges in Market Making, Alpha, and Benchmark execution
• Using public and proprietary data, identify new opportunities to generate P&L
• Develop research all the way from prototype to production
• Analyse the behaviours of production trading models on an on-going basis, looking for areas of improvement
• Share your expert AI insights and guidance with eFX colleagues

What we value

These skills will help you succeed in this role:
• Creative thinkers who are motivated by challenging (stochastic, non-stationary, non-linear, partially observed, very low SNR) problems
• A firm understanding of why just throwing data at say TensorFlow libraries doesn't work
• A healthy scepticism about the robustness and generalisability of in-sample results
• A working habit of first investigating simpler, parsimonious models
• Desire to work within a collaborative, team-driven environment

Education & Preferred Qualifications
• Post-graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics, or similar)
• Experience of a fast prototyping language such as Python (preferably), or Matlab, R, etc..
• Working knowledge of an industrial scale language such as Java or C++ is a plus

Are you the right candidate? Yes!

We truly believe in the power that comes from the diverse backgrounds and experiences our employees bring with them. Although each vacancy details what we are looking for, we don't necessarily need you to fulfil all of them when applying. If you like change and innovation, seek to see the bigger picture, make data driven decisions and are a good team player, you could be a great fit.

We're building an exciting online community focused on teaching individuals how to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create and automate trading strategies using PineScript on TradingView. Our goal is to empower traders by showing them how to translate their trading ideas into functional, backtested algorithms.

We're seeking a talented and innovative developer who is an expert in both PineScript and utilizing AI/LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) for code generation and strategy development. You will be a core part of our mission, not only developing PineScript trading algorithms but also meticulously documenting your AI-assisted development process to assist in the creation of educational content for our community.

The ideal candidate will help us demonstrate how AI can be used to build PineScript strategies from scratch, from initial concept to a profitably backtested algorithm ready for deployment and automation (e.g., via webhooks to services like Traders Post).

This is a long-term, part-time opportunity for someone passionate about the intersection of AI, trading, and education.

Responsibilities:

- Utilize AI/LLM tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to generate, test, and refine PineScript trading algorithms and indicators.

- Develop 1-3 PineScript trading strategies with demonstrably profitable backtests within the first 30 days.

- Thoroughly document your entire development process and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), emphasizing how AI was used at each step. This documentation will serve as educational material for our community.

- Collaborate on creating a clear, replicable system for community members to follow when building their own AI-assisted PineScript strategies.

- Integrate developed PineScript strategies with TradingView and prepare them for webhook automation.

- Debug and optimize PineScript code for performance and accuracy.

Required Skills & Experience:

- Proven expertise in PineScript development: Ability to write complex trading strategies and indicators in PineScript manually (without AI assistance). Please provide examples or a portfolio of your PineScript work.

- Demonstrable experience using AI/LLMs for code generation and problem-solving (e.g., using tools like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Cursor to generate or assist with PineScript or other code).

- Strong understanding of technical analysis, trading concepts, and strategy backtesting methodologies.

- Ability to systematically document processes and create clear, replicable SOPs.

- Excellent communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts simply.

- Self-motivated and able to work independently to meet deadlines.

Preferred Qualifications (Bonus Points):

- You already have existing PineScript strategies with a track record of profitable backtests that you can showcase (and ideally, demonstrate how AI could have been used or was used in their creation/refinement).

- Experience with webhook integrations for trading automation (e.g., Traders Post, 3Commas).

- Familiarity with creating educational content (written or video).

- Interest in agentic workflows and AI automations for agentic TA/FA analysis (this is a secondary, future goal).

To Apply:

Please submit your proposal and include:

1. A brief introduction highlighting your experience with PineScript and AI tools for code generation.

2. Examples of PineScript projects you have completed.

3. Describe your experience using AI (like Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.) to assist in coding or strategy development. If possible, provide a specific example.

4. Confirm your availability for part-time, long-term work and your acceptance or alternative offer of the proposed hourly rate.

5. (Optional) If you have existing profitable PineScript strategies, please mention them.

The Quant Analytics department at Bloomberg sits within Enterprise Products and is responsible for modeling market data, pricing, and risk calculations of financial derivatives across all asset classes. Our C++ libraries are used by all Bloomberg products and services, including the Terminal with over 300,000 clients, trading system solutions, enterprise risk management, and derivatives valuation services.

The department includes several Quant teams focused on different asset classes, as well as portfolio-level analytics and model validation. These teams deliver C++ libraries, supported by Python-based validation and testing, that are integrated by the Engineering department into Bloomberg's IT systems.

The Quant Library Architecture (QLA) team offers the opportunity to build experience at the cutting edge of C++ and financial mathematics, engaging with and influencing a wide variety of stakeholders of differing skill sets, to deliver scalable and strategic enterprise pricing and risk solutions. QLA is a small team of C++ experts tasked with helping the Quants be as productive as possible, for the long term. We are seeking a proficient C++ developer, with a strong interest in modern software development life-cycle practices.

We'll trust you to:
• Support Quants; owning the developer experience for Quants. We build and debug C++ libraries either in VS Code remote containers in Docker, or directly on Unix hosts. Much of the infrastructure is provided by Engineering, but QLA maintain significant additional tooling to provide Quants the most powerful and usable development environment possible.
• Proactively maintain integration builds and test infrastructure. We run largely automated CI/CD builds with a wide variety of static analysis and other code quality assurance tooling.
