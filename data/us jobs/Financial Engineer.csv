Numeric is the modern data platform for accounting and finance. We weave data, workflows, and AI together to help automate and elevate accounting.

Customers depend on us as the operating platform for their accounting, as well as the reporting, analytics, and observability layer for their financial data.

Why you might join us:
• Strong product market fit: we tripled our recurring revenue in 2024 and we're accelerating. Our customers represent a wide audience with companies like OpenAI, Braze, Figma, Anthropic, and many more as well as smaller series A and series B companies.
• Excellence: we believe in building the best workplace for high-performers, and value excellent ICs as the core of our strategy and execution.
• Massive opportunity & leverage: accounting is 20 years out of date, and every company from series A to enterprise is duct-taping their financial data together. Accountants face a growing, unsolved data problem as a consequence of complexity, data, and system fragmentation, yet do not have the tools to address it. These problems are important and difficult, yet solvable.
• Strong support: we've raised over $35 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, IVP, and Founders Fund as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.
• Customer partnership: you will meet with users in your first weeks on the job. Engineers spend time directly with our users in order to build deep understanding and context on our audience and their problems.
• Agency: we believe the best products are built when great engineers have the support of a strong team, the agency to exercise their creativity, and deep problems to tackle. Engineers do great work when they're having fun with teammates that energize and inspire them.

About the role:

As an engineer at Numeric, you will own end-to-end execution of product execution as well as inform product strategy and direction. We look for bright, fast builders with strong fundamentals and a focus on helping our users and solving the right problems.

What you might work on:

Developing our financial data platform, consisting of:
• a synchronization and transformation system which drives the unified data model behind our reporting, analytics, etc.
• the reporting experience, in which end-users can flexibly define highly-structured projections of financials to be saved as reports and integrated into their workflows. Reports are traceable and composable, allowing users to drill down to the underlying transaction-level details and more.

Expanding and scaling the automation layer:
• Our generalizable subledger offering allows users to drop a contract file and let us do the rest. We automate the full cycle accounting treatment, in which we:
• parse source documentation and extract information needed to produce the accounting treatment and inputs
• project change over time, including handling new events and unanticipated changes on the timeline
• synchronize to and from external accounting systems, yielding end-to-end automation of the accounting workflow
• Transaction monitoring to detect, flag, and resolve anomalies & bad data, preventing downstream headaches and errors.

A new transactional foundation:
• Our platform to connect and automate the graph of a company's assets and activities, opening the door to greater automation and insight into the activities of the organization.

And much more.

How we work:

The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. You’ll meet with customers in your first weeks and think from first principles about how to solve problems.

Numeric is the modern data platform for accounting and finance. We weave data, workflows, and AI together to help automate and elevate accounting.

Customers depend on us as the operating platform for their accounting, as well as the reporting, analytics, and observability layer for their financial data.

Why you might join us:
• Strong product market fit: we tripled our recurring revenue in 2024 and we're accelerating. Our customers represent a wide audience with companies like OpenAI, Braze, Figma, Anthropic, and many more as well as smaller series A and series B companies.
• Excellence: we believe in building the best workplace for high-performers, and value excellent ICs as the core of our strategy and execution.
• Massive opportunity & leverage: accounting is 20 years out of date, and every company from series A to enterprise is duct-taping their financial data together. Accountants face a growing, unsolved data problem as a consequence of complexity, data, and system fragmentation, yet do not have the tools to address it. These problems are important and difficult, yet solvable.
• Strong support: we've raised over $35 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, IVP, and Founders Fund as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.
• Customer partnership: you will meet with users in your first weeks on the job. Engineers spend time directly with our users in order to build deep understanding and context on our audience and their problems.
• Agency: we believe the best products are built when great engineers have the support of a strong team, the agency to exercise their creativity, and deep problems to tackle. Engineers do great work when they're having fun with teammates that energize and inspire them.

About the role:

As an engineer at Numeric, you will own end-to-end execution of product execution as well as inform product strategy and direction. We look for bright, fast builders with strong fundamentals and a focus on helping our users and solving the right problems.

What you might work on:

Developing our financial data platform, consisting of:
• a synchronization and transformation system which drives the unified data model behind our reporting, analytics, etc.
• the reporting experience, in which end-users can flexibly define highly-structured projections of financials to be saved as reports and integrated into their workflows. Reports are traceable and composable, allowing users to drill down to the underlying transaction-level details and more.

Expanding and scaling the automation layer:
• Our generalizable subledger offering allows users to drop a contract file and let us do the rest. We automate the full cycle accounting treatment, in which we:
• parse source documentation and extract information needed to produce the accounting treatment and inputs
• project change over time, including handling new events and unanticipated changes on the timeline
• synchronize to and from external accounting systems, yielding end-to-end automation of the accounting workflow
• Transaction monitoring to detect, flag, and resolve anomalies & bad data, preventing downstream headaches and errors.

A new transactional foundation:
• Our platform to connect and automate the graph of a company's assets and activities, opening the door to greater automation and insight into the activities of the organization.

And much more.

How we work:

The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. You’ll meet with customers in your first weeks and think from first principles about how to solve problems.

Numeric is the modern data platform for accounting and finance. We weave data, workflows, and AI together to help automate and elevate accounting.

Customers depend on us as the operating platform for their accounting, as well as the reporting, analytics, and observability layer for their financial data.

Why you might join us:
• Strong product market fit: we tripled our recurring revenue in 2024 and we're accelerating. Our customers represent a wide audience with companies like OpenAI, Braze, Figma, Anthropic, and many more as well as smaller series A and series B companies.
• Excellence: we believe in building the best workplace for high-performers, and value excellent ICs as the core of our strategy and execution.
• Massive opportunity & leverage: accounting is 20 years out of date, and every company from series A to enterprise is duct-taping their financial data together. Accountants face a growing, unsolved data problem as a consequence of complexity, data, and system fragmentation, yet do not have the tools to address it. These problems are important and difficult, yet solvable.
• Strong support: we've raised over $35 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, IVP, and Founders Fund as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.
• Customer partnership: you will meet with users in your first weeks on the job. Engineers spend time directly with our users in order to build deep understanding and context on our audience and their problems.
• Agency: we believe the best products are built when great engineers have the support of a strong team, the agency to exercise their creativity, and deep problems to tackle. Engineers do great work when they're having fun with teammates that energize and inspire them.

About the role:

As an engineer at Numeric, you will own end-to-end execution of product execution as well as inform product strategy and direction. We look for bright, fast builders with strong fundamentals and a focus on helping our users and solving the right problems.

What you might work on:

Developing our financial data platform, consisting of:
• a synchronization and transformation system which drives the unified data model behind our reporting, analytics, etc.
• the reporting experience, in which end-users can flexibly define highly-structured projections of financials to be saved as reports and integrated into their workflows. Reports are traceable and composable, allowing users to drill down to the underlying transaction-level details and more.

Expanding and scaling the automation layer:
• Our generalizable subledger offering allows users to drop a contract file and let us do the rest. We automate the full cycle accounting treatment, in which we:
• parse source documentation and extract information needed to produce the accounting treatment and inputs
• project change over time, including handling new events and unanticipated changes on the timeline
• synchronize to and from external accounting systems, yielding end-to-end automation of the accounting workflow
• Transaction monitoring to detect, flag, and resolve anomalies & bad data, preventing downstream headaches and errors.

A new transactional foundation:
• Our platform to connect and automate the graph of a company's assets and activities, opening the door to greater automation and insight into the activities of the organization.

And much more.

How we work:

The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. You’ll meet with customers in your first weeks and think from first principles about how to solve problems.

Numeric is the modern data platform for accounting and finance. We weave data, workflows, and AI together to help automate and elevate accounting.

Customers depend on us as the operating platform for their accounting, as well as the reporting, analytics, and observability layer for their financial data.

Why you might join us:
• Strong product market fit: we tripled our recurring revenue in 2024 and we're accelerating. Our customers represent a wide audience with companies like OpenAI, Braze, Figma, Anthropic, and many more as well as smaller series A and series B companies.
• Excellence: we believe in building the best workplace for high-performers, and value excellent ICs as the core of our strategy and execution.
• Massive opportunity & leverage: accounting is 20 years out of date, and every company from series A to enterprise is duct-taping their financial data together. Accountants face a growing, unsolved data problem as a consequence of complexity, data, and system fragmentation, yet do not have the tools to address it. These problems are important and difficult, yet solvable.
• Strong support: we've raised over $35 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, IVP, and Founders Fund as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.
• Customer partnership: you will meet with users in your first weeks on the job. Engineers spend time directly with our users in order to build deep understanding and context on our audience and their problems.
• Agency: we believe the best products are built when great engineers have the support of a strong team, the agency to exercise their creativity, and deep problems to tackle. Engineers do great work when they're having fun with teammates that energize and inspire them.

About the role:

As an engineer at Numeric, you will own end-to-end execution of product execution as well as inform product strategy and direction. We look for bright, fast builders with strong fundamentals and a focus on helping our users and solving the right problems.

What you might work on:

Developing our financial data platform, consisting of:
• a synchronization and transformation system which drives the unified data model behind our reporting, analytics, etc.
• the reporting experience, in which end-users can flexibly define highly-structured projections of financials to be saved as reports and integrated into their workflows. Reports are traceable and composable, allowing users to drill down to the underlying transaction-level details and more.

Expanding and scaling the automation layer:
• Our generalizable subledger offering allows users to drop a contract file and let us do the rest. We automate the full cycle accounting treatment, in which we:
• parse source documentation and extract information needed to produce the accounting treatment and inputs
• project change over time, including handling new events and unanticipated changes on the timeline
• synchronize to and from external accounting systems, yielding end-to-end automation of the accounting workflow
• Transaction monitoring to detect, flag, and resolve anomalies & bad data, preventing downstream headaches and errors.

A new transactional foundation:
• Our platform to connect and automate the graph of a company's assets and activities, opening the door to greater automation and insight into the activities of the organization.

And much more.

How we work:

The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. You’ll meet with customers in your first weeks and think from first principles about how to solve problems.

You need experience building trading systems but it does not matter what the asset class is. If you have experience with execution management or order management systems, that would be ideal but is not essential.

Numeric is the modern data platform for accounting and finance. We weave data, workflows, and AI together to help automate and elevate accounting.

Customers depend on us as the operating platform for their accounting, as well as the reporting, analytics, and observability layer for their financial data.

Why you might join us:
• Strong product market fit: we tripled our recurring revenue in 2024 and we're accelerating. Our customers represent a wide audience with companies like OpenAI, Braze, Figma, Anthropic, and many more as well as smaller series A and series B companies.
• Excellence: we believe in building the best workplace for high-performers, and value excellent ICs as the core of our strategy and execution.
• Massive opportunity & leverage: accounting is 20 years out of date, and every company from series A to enterprise is duct-taping their financial data together. Accountants face a growing, unsolved data problem as a consequence of complexity, data, and system fragmentation, yet do not have the tools to address it. These problems are important and difficult, yet solvable.
• Strong support: we've raised over $35 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, IVP, and Founders Fund as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more.
• Customer partnership: you will meet with users in your first weeks on the job. Engineers spend time directly with our users in order to build deep understanding and context on our audience and their problems.
• Agency: we believe the best products are built when great engineers have the support of a strong team, the agency to exercise their creativity, and deep problems to tackle. Engineers do great work when they're having fun with teammates that energize and inspire them.

About the role:

As an engineer at Numeric, you will own end-to-end execution of product execution as well as inform product strategy and direction. We look for bright, fast builders with strong fundamentals and a focus on helping our users and solving the right problems.

What you might work on:

Developing our financial data platform, consisting of:
• a synchronization and transformation system which drives the unified data model behind our reporting, analytics, etc.
• the reporting experience, in which end-users can flexibly define highly-structured projections of financials to be saved as reports and integrated into their workflows. Reports are traceable and composable, allowing users to drill down to the underlying transaction-level details and more.

Expanding and scaling the automation layer:
• Our generalizable subledger offering allows users to drop a contract file and let us do the rest. We automate the full cycle accounting treatment, in which we:
• parse source documentation and extract information needed to produce the accounting treatment and inputs
• project change over time, including handling new events and unanticipated changes on the timeline
• synchronize to and from external accounting systems, yielding end-to-end automation of the accounting workflow
• Transaction monitoring to detect, flag, and resolve anomalies & bad data, preventing downstream headaches and errors.

A new transactional foundation:
• Our platform to connect and automate the graph of a company's assets and activities, opening the door to greater automation and insight into the activities of the organization.

And much more.

How we work:

The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. You’ll meet with customers in your first weeks and think from first principles about how to solve problems.
