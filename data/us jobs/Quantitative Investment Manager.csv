We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

Quantitative Systematic Trader – Master's: 2025,Susquehanna International Group,"New York, NY",LinkedIn,https://serpapi.com/searches/685132f632f11de2af916392/images/690c1b5d38e91f004be045b42f0b8d3426157dc0c84aa892135ed5ec603a0f7c.gif,"['11 days ago', 'Full-time', 'Health insurance']","Overview

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.
