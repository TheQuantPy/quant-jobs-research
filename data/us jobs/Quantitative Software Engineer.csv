Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.
