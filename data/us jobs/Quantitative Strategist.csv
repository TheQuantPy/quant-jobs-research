We are responsible for managing the firm's liquidity, funding, balance sheet and capital to maximize net interest income and return on equity through liability planning and execution, financial resource allocation, asset liability management, and liquidity portfolio management.

In Corporate Treasury Engineering, you'll find an exciting confluence of computer science, finance and mathematics being used to solve for what our shareholders would like from us - a high return for the right risk taken.

Corporate Treasury Strats welcomes applicants with a PhD, a Masters, or a Bachelors in financial engineering, physics, statistics, applied math, or other quantitative sciences. Strong problem-solving skills, mathematical fluency, and programming abilities are required.

How you will fulfill your potential:

• Develop software and analytics to progress Corporate Treasury's mandates: interest rate pricing & risk management, trade execution, funding optimization & liquidity risk management and cash & collateral management.
• Optimize the firm's liability stack by developing balance sheet analytics and hedging strategies.
• Actively engage with Corporate Treasury Core team, supporting risk/P&L reporting and building analytics to explain trends.
• Work with other Strats and technology departments to optimally leverage financial resources to achieve commercial priorities.
• Perform quantitative analysis and facilitate business understanding of technical results.
Skills and experience we are looking for:

• Expertise in an aspect of quantitative analysis, e.g., mathematics, physics, statistics, stochastic calculus, scientific computing, econometrics, machine learning algorithms, financial modeling.
• Extensive background in object-oriented computer programming: C++, Java, Python or equivalent language, preferably in large scale financial or technical computation.
• Experience with financial markets and assets; preference for vanilla interest rate derivative pricing, bond pricing, curve construction, hedging strategies and risk management.
• Excellent communication skills, including experience speaking to both technical and business audiences and working globally across multiple regions.
• 1+ years of relevant, continuous experience.

Company Description

Radix Trading is a proprietary firm focused on quantitative research and scientific trading. We’re one of the most active liquidity providers on electronic exchanges globally, and have leveraged a culture of open, collaborative innovation to scale the reach of our ideas and pace of iteration, without having to scale our headcount (we’re still less than 150 people across Chicago, Amsterdam, and NYC).

In our industry, the vast majority of ideas will fail. So, since inception, we’ve focused on continuous enhancement of our automated research platform and cutting-edge technology, allowing us to fail faster than the day prior, glean insights from each idea, and leverage individual contributions to the fullest across our entire organization.

We’re led by Ben Blander and Michael Rauchman, who played key roles in the rise of electronic trading, but both recognized a major gap in the industry — a true focus on research processes coupled with an open organizational structure that fosters effective collaboration.

--------------------------

Ben Blander - former head of Citadel’s high frequency group and a key contributor in growing their P&L from $75 million in 2005 to $1.15 billion in 2008 (Source: http://www.cnbc.com/id/39099331). Previously Ben earned a PhD in Math (Algebraic Topology under Peter May) from the University of Chicago.

Michael Rauchman - formerly GETCO's CTO, head of Americas equities, and global head of ForEx. As a hands-on leader, Michael was instrumental in the development of many trading strategies as well as the underlying architecture and code.

Why trading?

If you want to get near-immediate feedback on your best ideas, while leveraging cutting-edge technology, the trading industry is hard to beat. Every day we’re competing with some of the smartest, most driven people in the world trying to take our money -- and if we don’t stay at the very top of our game in research, technology, and economics, they will.

And while the highly-publicized wave of high-frequency or “flash” trading based on sheer speed of execution might have reached its limit, we see continued opportunities with our strategy of using statistical research to outsmart the competition.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJRdWFudGl0YXRpdmUgQnVzaW5lc3MgU3RyYXRlZ2lzdCIsImNvbXBhbnlfbmFtZSI6IlJhZGl4IFRyYWRpbmcgRXhwZXJpZW5jZWQgSm9iIEJvYXJkIiwiYWRkcmVzc19jaXR5IjoiQ2hpY2FnbywgSUwiLCJodGlkb2NpZCI6Ink5blVJZDM0MUU5bnVNdlVBQUFBQUE9PSIsInV1bGUiOiJ3K0NBSVFJQ0lXU1d4c2FXNXZhWE1zVlc1cGRHVmtJRk4wWVhSbGN3IiwiZ2wiOiJ1cyIsImhsIjoiZW4ifQ==,,,,Full-time,2025-06-17 11:20:51.714153,Quantitative Strategist,"Illinois, United States",

• Optimize the firm's liability stack by developing balance sheet analytics and hedging strategies.
• Actively engage with Corporate Treasury Core team, supporting risk/P&L reporting and building analytics to explain trends.

We're looking for a Quantitative Strategist Intern who thrives on challenging conventional market assumptions and doesn't just analyze data-but uncovers insights others overlook.

In this role, you'll develop models to inform and optimize investment decisions . The best insights aren't always obvious-some are buried in unstructured data, financial reports, and economic indicators. If you can extract meaningful signals from complexity, leverage Python to transform raw data into actionable intelligence, and push beyond surface-level analysis, we want to hear from you.

Develop Quantitative Models - Build and refine statistical and machine-learning models to inform and optimize investment decisions.
Extract and Analyze Data - Identify key financial insights from structured and unstructured sources using Python.
Leverage Economic Indicators - Incorporate macroeconomic trends into investment strategies.
Challenge Market Assumptions - Conduct independent research to uncover inefficiencies and overlooked opportunities.
Who You Are Graduate-Level Quantitative Background - Currently pursuing a graduate degree in Actuarial Science, Statistics, or Financial Mathematics.
Obsessive Researcher - You don't stop at the headline-you dig into the footnotes, finding value in details others ignore.
Python Proficient - You can write efficient scripts for data extraction, analysis, and automation.
Data Extraction Expert - You excel at pulling meaningful insights from complex, unstructured documents.
Independent & Analytical - You question assumptions and rely on data, not consensus, to drive decisions.
What You'll Gain Hands-on Experience - Work on real-world quantitative problems in a data-driven investment environment.
Exposure to Senior Decision-Makers - Gain direct insights from experienced professionals and see your work impact strategy.

If you're excited to apply your quantitative skills in a high-stakes environment and want to work with a team that values deep research and independent thinking, apply now.
