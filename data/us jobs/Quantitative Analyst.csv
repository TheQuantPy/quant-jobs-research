Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re expanding our engineering core and seeking an exceptional early-career engineer to help implement, extend, and maintain the recursive infrastructure that powers our trading algorithms. You’ll work on real components in a system already shaped by the constraints of curvature and the realities of execution.

An ideal candidate has excelled in computer science or mathematics at a top-tier institution (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU), with a major GPA of 3.9 or higher. In addition, they’ll typically have one or more of the following: an exceptional placement in ICPC, Putnam, IOI, or IMO; a tier-1 quant internship (Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, etc.); or multiple internships at top tech firms in quantitatively rigorous roles. We assume strong programming ability and expect a solid foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and machine learning.

Who You Are
• You’ve studied computer science, mathematics, or a related field at a top institution, and performed at the highest academic level
• You move comfortably between abstraction and implementation, and can reason through complexity without needing a predefined path
• You're a fluent programmer who can translate geometric or statistical insight into working systems
• You thrive in lean, fast-moving environments where ownership is implicit and structure emerges through iteration
• You’re not just technically sharp—you’re intellectually open. You want to see mathematics differently, and you’re ready to work on something that might reshape how you think

Responsibilities
• Take ownership of core engineering tasks, particularly those involving execution logic, inter-process communication, and exchange connectivity
• Work on concurrency-sensitive components, helping ensure the system remains robust under live market conditions and asynchronous inputs
• Contribute to the refinement and expansion of our internal mathematical infrastructure, translating geometric and statistical structures into clean, maintainable code
• Collaborate directly with the chief executive and senior quantitative researchers to align implementation with the system’s recursive foundation
• Operate within a live, evolving system, debugging, optimizing, and shaping components that matter under real-world pressure

Compensation

Base salary for this role ranges from $150,000 to $200,000, with a year-end performance bonus. The role also includes meaningful equity incentives designed to reward long-term impact and ownership. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be offered depending on the final structure of the offer.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

At DSA, we are driven to create a smarter and cleaner energy future, and we are always looking for talented professionals who share our passion for achieving this goal.

We work on a wide variety of energy projects across North America, using causal and predictive analytics to assess how new technologies and interventions affect energy use and planning. All staff work directly with our senior energy experts to produce high-quality tools and analyses for our clients, allowing employees to develop skills while solving pressing questions for programs and policy.
