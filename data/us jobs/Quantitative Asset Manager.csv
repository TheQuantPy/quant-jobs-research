Overview

About Bayview Asset Management, LLC
Bayview Asset Management, LLC (“Bayview”), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.

With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.

About MSR Portfolio Management
The Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSR”) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (“Lakeview”) is the largest of Bayview’s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.

MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that – the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.

Essential Responsibilities & Duties
Your primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

• Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model.
• Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process.
• Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier.
• Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud).
• Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.

Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following:

• Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio
• Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluation

Your work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations. We are a small yet efficient team where we expect to rely on you and your expertise, as we do with all members of our team.

Education & Experience
• Minimum of 2+ years of direct work experience
• Candidates typically possess an undergraduate degree in a hard science, math, computer science, engineering or finance. A Master’s degree is a plus.
• Basic knowledge in Fixed Income
