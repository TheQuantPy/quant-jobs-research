Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re hiring an experienced Quantitative Research Engineer to help guide the next phase of the system’s evolution. This role goes beyond implementation. You’ll work directly with the founders to shape internal structure, clarify abstractions, and extend the system through recursive feedback. You’ll operate across both mathematical and engineering layers—owning core components and identifying structural bottlenecks as the system continues to evolve.

This is a co-founder-level opportunity for someone who leads through reasoning, not hierarchy. We don’t need a manager—we need someone who holds the field clearly enough that others naturally align around it.

What We're Looking For

You’ve worked in serious trading or research environments—whether at firms like Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, Two Sigma, Jump, or similar—or in performance-critical systems at top-tier tech companies. You’ve touched live systems. You’ve made decisions that mattered.

You don’t just write code—you shape systems. You know when to move fast—and when moving fast would break the structure you’re holding. You’ve guided others—not through authority, but through how you think. You’re rigorous with what you build, open with what you don’t know, and capable of reasoning through systems where structure governs behavior, not heuristics.

Responsibilities
• Architect and implement components within our system’s recursive foundation, from curved input logic to order execution
• Own high-leverage infrastructure while helping offload implementation once structural clarity has emerged
• Work directly with the chief executive and other senior researchers to compress structure, surface what holds, and bend abstraction into implementation
• Clarify complexity by holding structure clearly enough that alignment becomes inevitable
• Own performance, stability, and structural alignment of the system under live market conditions

Qualifications
• 3+ years of experience in quantitative trading, research engineering, or high-performance systems
• Deep programming fluency (Python required; Bash/Java/C++ optional but welcome)
• Comfort with asynchronous systems, concurrency, and real-time performance constraints
• Strong mathematical intuition; able to reason in geometry, probability, and information space
• Academic pedigree (Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU, etc.) is valued—but secondary to field-tested capability

Compensation

Compensation for this role is highly competitive and includes a base salary, year-end performance bonus, and meaningful equity incentives structured for long-term ownership and co-founder alignment. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be included based on the final offer.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We let collectors buy, sell, vault, and finance their cards in one place and we are backed by leaders at Stripe, Coinbase, Seven Seven Six, and pro athletes like Tom Brady and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Our next frontier is real-time pricing at scale—the Alt Value that powers every trade, loan, and product on the platform.

The Opportunity

You will own the pricing engine that sets Alt Value across millions of cards and future asset classes. Think of it as building Bloomberg Fair-Value for collectibles. You will architect the models, production pipeline, and monitoring that turn messy auction data into live data our customers trust.
What You’ll Tackle
• Build the price engine. Design, train, and deploy time-series and tree-based models (XGBoost, CatBoost, sklearn, lightGBM) that predict fair value and forecast volatility.
• Harden the data layer. Ingest and reconcile auction feeds, marketplace listings, and private-sale data. Handle splits, dupes, zero-comp situations, and stale marks.
• Ship to production. Own model orchestration with Airflow, feature stores, real-time inference endpoints, and rollback strategies.
• Quantitative R&D. Test market microstructure effects (extended bidding, buyer premiums, cash advances) and bake insights into pricing logic.
• API & analytics. Expose Alt Value as a public API, power in-app price alerts, and deliver dashboards the business can act on.
• Lead the function. Hire and mentor a small team of DS/MLEs and set the standard for code quality, review, and testing.
Tech Stack

Python, SQL, AWS (S3, ECS, Lambda), Airflow, dbt, Postgres, Spark, XGBoost, sklearn, CatBoost, GitHub Actions. (Nice-to-have: TypeScript, FastAPI, Grafana, Datadog)
What You Bring
• 9+ years in quantitative finance, ML engineering, or similar.
• Deep time-series and forecasting experience, ideally on illiquid or auction assets.
• Proven path from Jupyter to production with CI/CD, testing, and automated monitoring.
• Track record of improving MAE or PnL with your models in live systems.
• Fluent in Python, SQL, and modern data tooling.
• Strong communication: you can explain heteroscedastic noise to engineers
Compensation & Perks
• Founder-level impact on a green-field pricing platform
• $200 / month remote-work stipend, $100 / month wellness stipend, and WeWork access
• Flexible PTO and generous parental leave
• Premium health, dental, vision, and HSA
• 401(k)
• Base salary: $275K – $350K, plus equity. Offers may vary based on experience, location, and other factors.

We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at Susquehanna are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Researcher , you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
• Experience working on in-depth research projects
• Finance experience is not a requirement

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We let collectors buy, sell, vault, and finance their cards in one place and we are backed by leaders at Stripe, Coinbase, Seven Seven Six, and pro athletes like Tom Brady and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Our next frontier is real-time pricing at scale—the Alt Value that powers every trade, loan, and product on the platform.

The Opportunity

You will own the pricing engine that sets Alt Value across millions of cards and future asset classes. Think of it as building Bloomberg Fair-Value for collectibles. You will architect the models, production pipeline, and monitoring that turn messy auction data into live data our customers trust.
What You’ll Tackle
• Build the price engine. Design, train, and deploy time-series and tree-based models (XGBoost, CatBoost, sklearn, lightGBM) that predict fair value and forecast volatility.
• Harden the data layer. Ingest and reconcile auction feeds, marketplace listings, and private-sale data. Handle splits, dupes, zero-comp situations, and stale marks.
• Ship to production. Own model orchestration with Airflow, feature stores, real-time inference endpoints, and rollback strategies.
• Quantitative R&D. Test market microstructure effects (extended bidding, buyer premiums, cash advances) and bake insights into pricing logic.
• API & analytics. Expose Alt Value as a public API, power in-app price alerts, and deliver dashboards the business can act on.
• Lead the function. Hire and mentor a small team of DS/MLEs and set the standard for code quality, review, and testing.
Tech Stack

Python, SQL, AWS (S3, ECS, Lambda), Airflow, dbt, Postgres, Spark, XGBoost, sklearn, CatBoost, GitHub Actions. (Nice-to-have: TypeScript, FastAPI, Grafana, Datadog)
What You Bring
• 9+ years in quantitative finance, ML engineering, or similar.
• Deep time-series and forecasting experience, ideally on illiquid or auction assets.
• Proven path from Jupyter to production with CI/CD, testing, and automated monitoring.
• Track record of improving MAE or PnL with your models in live systems.
• Fluent in Python, SQL, and modern data tooling.
• Strong communication: you can explain heteroscedastic noise to engineers
Compensation & Perks
• Founder-level impact on a green-field pricing platform
• $200 / month remote-work stipend, $100 / month wellness stipend, and WeWork access
• Flexible PTO and generous parental leave
• Premium health, dental, vision, and HSA
• 401(k)
• Base salary: $275K – $350K, plus equity. Offers may vary based on experience, location, and other factors.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

• Harden the data layer. Ingest and reconcile auction feeds, marketplace listings, and private-sale data. Handle splits, dupes, zero-comp situations, and stale marks.
• Ship to production. Own model orchestration with Airflow, feature stores, real-time inference endpoints, and rollback strategies.
• Quantitative R&D. Test market microstructure effects (extended bidding, buyer premiums, cash advances) and bake insights into pricing logic.
• API & analytics. Expose Alt Value as a public API, power in-app price alerts, and deliver dashboards the business can act on.
• Lead the function. Hire and mentor a small team of DS/MLEs and set the standard for code quality, review, and testing.

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re hiring an experienced Quantitative Research Engineer to help guide the next phase of the system’s evolution. This role goes beyond implementation. You’ll work directly with the founders to shape internal structure, clarify abstractions, and extend the system through recursive feedback. You’ll operate across both mathematical and engineering layers—owning core components and identifying structural bottlenecks as the system continues to evolve.

This is a co-founder-level opportunity for someone who leads through reasoning, not hierarchy. We don’t need a manager—we need someone who holds the field clearly enough that others naturally align around it.

What We're Looking For

You’ve worked in serious trading or research environments—whether at firms like Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, Two Sigma, Jump, or similar—or in performance-critical systems at top-tier tech companies. You’ve touched live systems. You’ve made decisions that mattered.

You don’t just write code—you shape systems. You know when to move fast—and when moving fast would break the structure you’re holding. You’ve guided others—not through authority, but through how you think. You’re rigorous with what you build, open with what you don’t know, and capable of reasoning through systems where structure governs behavior, not heuristics.

Responsibilities
• Architect and implement components within our system’s recursive foundation, from curved input logic to order execution
• Own high-leverage infrastructure while helping offload implementation once structural clarity has emerged
• Work directly with the chief executive and other senior researchers to compress structure, surface what holds, and bend abstraction into implementation
• Clarify complexity by holding structure clearly enough that alignment becomes inevitable
• Own performance, stability, and structural alignment of the system under live market conditions

Qualifications
• 3+ years of experience in quantitative trading, research engineering, or high-performance systems
• Deep programming fluency (Python required; Bash/Java/C++ optional but welcome)
• Comfort with asynchronous systems, concurrency, and real-time performance constraints
• Strong mathematical intuition; able to reason in geometry, probability, and information space
• Academic pedigree (Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU, etc.) is valued—but secondary to field-tested capability

Compensation

Compensation for this role is highly competitive and includes a base salary, year-end performance bonus, and meaningful equity incentives structured for long-term ownership and co-founder alignment. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be included based on the final offer.

We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at Susquehanna are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Researcher , you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
• Experience working on in-depth research projects
• Finance experience is not a requirement

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We let collectors buy, sell, vault, and finance their cards in one place and we are backed by leaders at Stripe, Coinbase, Seven Seven Six, and pro athletes like Tom Brady and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Our next frontier is real-time pricing at scale—the Alt Value that powers every trade, loan, and product on the platform.

The Opportunity

You will own the pricing engine that sets Alt Value across millions of cards and future asset classes. Think of it as building Bloomberg Fair-Value for collectibles. You will architect the models, production pipeline, and monitoring that turn messy auction data into live data our customers trust.
What You’ll Tackle
• Build the price engine. Design, train, and deploy time-series and tree-based models (XGBoost, CatBoost, sklearn, lightGBM) that predict fair value and forecast volatility.
• Harden the data layer. Ingest and reconcile auction feeds, marketplace listings, and private-sale data. Handle splits, dupes, zero-comp situations, and stale marks.
• Ship to production. Own model orchestration with Airflow, feature stores, real-time inference endpoints, and rollback strategies.
• Quantitative R&D. Test market microstructure effects (extended bidding, buyer premiums, cash advances) and bake insights into pricing logic.
• API & analytics. Expose Alt Value as a public API, power in-app price alerts, and deliver dashboards the business can act on.
• Lead the function. Hire and mentor a small team of DS/MLEs and set the standard for code quality, review, and testing.
Tech Stack

Python, SQL, AWS (S3, ECS, Lambda), Airflow, dbt, Postgres, Spark, XGBoost, sklearn, CatBoost, GitHub Actions. (Nice-to-have: TypeScript, FastAPI, Grafana, Datadog)
What You Bring
• 9+ years in quantitative finance, ML engineering, or similar.
• Deep time-series and forecasting experience, ideally on illiquid or auction assets.
• Proven path from Jupyter to production with CI/CD, testing, and automated monitoring.
• Track record of improving MAE or PnL with your models in live systems.
• Fluent in Python, SQL, and modern data tooling.
• Strong communication: you can explain heteroscedastic noise to engineers
Compensation & Perks
• Founder-level impact on a green-field pricing platform
• $200 / month remote-work stipend, $100 / month wellness stipend, and WeWork access
• Flexible PTO and generous parental leave
• Premium health, dental, vision, and HSA
• 401(k)
• Base salary: $275K – $350K, plus equity. Offers may vary based on experience, location, and other factors.

A leading US proprietary trading firm is scaling an elite AI-focused sub-team within its global mid-frequency equities business. This group is exploring novel applications of LLMs and other machine learning models to uncover untapped alpha signals from alternative and structured datasets.

They’re looking for a top-tier Quantitative Researcher with a track record of applying AI/ML in an investment context—someone who’s delivered measurable PnL impact and is ready to shape the next frontier of AI-driven alpha discovery.

The Setup

You’ll join a deeply collaborative team of researchers and technologists working on the front lines of systematic alpha generation. The environment combines research autonomy with high-caliber engineering support, powerful compute infrastructure (including distributed GPU clusters), and a flat structure that prioritizes speed, creativity, and execution.

What You’ll Work On
• Research and implement deep learning models (transformers, attention-based models, sequence architectures) for alpha signal discovery
• Apply novel AI reasoning frameworks such as Graph of Thoughts (GoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) to datasets including earnings transcripts, filings, ESG corpora, alt data, and market structure features
• Build adaptive features that generalize across geographies, regimes, and sectors
• Work side-by-side with traders and researchers to get models into production—refine signal decay, execution pathways, and live feedback loops
• Contribute to a shared research platform that will power strategy launches across the global book

What They’re Looking For
• Minimum of 2–5+ years of experience in a quantitative research role within a leading trading firm or hedge fund
• Demonstrated success applying machine learning or deep learning to live strategies (equities preferred, but open to exceptional candidates from other asset classes)
• Strong foundation in deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow), along with Python/C++
• PhD or Master’s in CS, Machine Learning, Applied Math, or similar
• Prior experience in publishing top tier scientific research within the major journals
• Track record demonstrating rapid iteration and translating novel research into commercial outcomes

How This Role Elevates Your Trajectory
• Learn how to bridge experimental research and real capital deployment
• Master how to de-risk deep learning in production through interpretable, testable pipelines
• Build a research track record tied to meaningful PnL and gain ownership of these outcomes

You’ll be joining a small, AI-first team with a clear remit: push boundaries, ship models, and redefine what quantitative signal research looks like.

At Onyx Alpha Partners, we pride ourselves on connecting elite talent with transformative roles in the financial sector. This position represents a remarkable opportunity for personal and professional growth in a stimulating and forward-thinking environment. If you're driven to push the boundaries of quantitative finance, we encourage you to apply and explore the potential to redefine industry standards with us.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJRdWFudGl0YXRpdmUgUmVzZWFyY2hlciDigJMgRGVlcCBMZWFybmluZyBcdTAwMjYgQUkgU2lnbmFsIERpc2NvdmVyeSAoRXF1aXRpZXMpIiwiY29tcGFueV9uYW1lIjoiT255eCBBbHBoYSBQYXJ0bmVycyIsImFkZHJlc3NfY2l0eSI6Ik5ldyBZb3JrLCBOWSIsImh0aWRvY2lkIjoiUlB1NWFlcUFhRlBJR25JbUFBQUFBQT09IiwidXVsZSI6IncrQ0FJUUlDSVdTV3hzYVc1dmFYTXNWVzVwZEdWa0lGTjBZWFJsY3ciLCJnbCI6InVzIiwiaGwiOiJlbiJ9,14 days ago,Full-time,200K–350K a year,2025-06-17 11:07:44.680192,Quantitative Researcher,"Illinois, United States",

Manifold Technologies is a quantitative trading firm building systems that curve with the market’s geometry. We don’t chase trends—we curve the field until structure reveals itself. Most systems collapse when curvature shifts. Ours adapts because it is built from within. Bayesian inference and differential geometry aren’t frameworks we borrow—they are the native language of our architecture.

We’re hiring an experienced Quantitative Research Engineer to help guide the next phase of the system’s evolution. This role goes beyond implementation. You’ll work directly with the founders to shape internal structure, clarify abstractions, and extend the system through recursive feedback. You’ll operate across both mathematical and engineering layers—owning core components and identifying structural bottlenecks as the system continues to evolve.

This is a co-founder-level opportunity for someone who leads through reasoning, not hierarchy. We don’t need a manager—we need someone who holds the field clearly enough that others naturally align around it.

What We're Looking For

You’ve worked in serious trading or research environments—whether at firms like Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, Two Sigma, Jump, or similar—or in performance-critical systems at top-tier tech companies. You’ve touched live systems. You’ve made decisions that mattered.

You don’t just write code—you shape systems. You know when to move fast—and when moving fast would break the structure you’re holding. You’ve guided others—not through authority, but through how you think. You’re rigorous with what you build, open with what you don’t know, and capable of reasoning through systems where structure governs behavior, not heuristics.

Responsibilities
• Architect and implement components within our system’s recursive foundation, from curved input logic to order execution
• Own high-leverage infrastructure while helping offload implementation once structural clarity has emerged
• Work directly with the chief executive and other senior researchers to compress structure, surface what holds, and bend abstraction into implementation
• Clarify complexity by holding structure clearly enough that alignment becomes inevitable
• Own performance, stability, and structural alignment of the system under live market conditions

Qualifications
• 3+ years of experience in quantitative trading, research engineering, or high-performance systems
• Deep programming fluency (Python required; Bash/Java/C++ optional but welcome)
• Comfort with asynchronous systems, concurrency, and real-time performance constraints
• Strong mathematical intuition; able to reason in geometry, probability, and information space
• Academic pedigree (Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU, etc.) is valued—but secondary to field-tested capability

Compensation

Compensation for this role is highly competitive and includes a base salary, year-end performance bonus, and meaningful equity incentives structured for long-term ownership and co-founder alignment. Additional benefits—such as health coverage, wellness stipends, or retirement contributions—may be included based on the final offer.

We’re looking for quant-minded strategists who value the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and cooperative thinking. Our Quantitative Systematic Traders combine the skills of quantitative research with the knowledge of trading to develop new electronic strategies and monitor real-time performance. As a true hybrid of our core disciplines, Quantitative Systematic Traders are constantly communicating and connecting ideas between trading, technology, and quantitative research.

The general life cycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Systematic Trader, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• To assess the strength of that trading signal, you will run it through our backtesting environment and carefully analyze its performance.
• If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What we're looking for
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Solid, analytical problem-solving skills
• Excellent logical reasoning
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Experience writing code to process and analyze large sets of data, especially in Python
• Experience in C++ or other low level programming languages is a plus
• Demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities
• Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Researcher position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

The annual base pay range for this role is $250,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. Susquehanna considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.

We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at Susquehanna are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
• This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
• As a Quantitative Researcher , you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
• Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
• You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
• Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
• As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
• Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

What We're Looking For
• Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
• Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
• Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
• Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
• Experience working on in-depth research projects
• Finance experience is not a requirement

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.

If you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to recruiting@sig.com . Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will not be eligible for an agency fee.
