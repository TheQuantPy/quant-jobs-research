The Opportunity

A leading US proprietary trading firm is scaling an elite AI-focused sub-team within its global mid-frequency equities business. This group is exploring novel applications of LLMs and other machine learning models to uncover untapped alpha signals from alternative and structured datasets.

They’re looking for a top-tier Quantitative Researcher with a track record of applying AI/ML in an investment context—someone who’s delivered measurable PnL impact and is ready to shape the next frontier of AI-driven alpha discovery.

The Setup

• Research and implement deep learning models (transformers, attention-based models, sequence architectures) for alpha signal discovery
• Apply novel AI reasoning frameworks such as Graph of Thoughts (GoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) to datasets including earnings transcripts, filings, ESG corpora, alt data, and market structure features
• Build adaptive features that generalize across geographies, regimes, and sectors
• Work side-by-side with traders and researchers to get models into production—refine signal decay, execution pathways, and live feedback loops
• Contribute to a shared research platform that will power strategy launches across the global book

What They’re Looking For
• Minimum of 2–5+ years of experience in a quantitative research role within a leading trading firm or hedge fund
• Demonstrated success applying machine learning or deep learning to live strategies (equities preferred, but open to exceptional candidates from other asset classes)

• Master how to de-risk deep learning in production through interpretable, testable pipelines
• Build a research track record tied to meaningful PnL and gain ownership of these outcomes

You’ll be joining a small, AI-first team with a clear remit: push boundaries, ship models, and redefine what quantitative signal research looks like.

At Onyx Alpha Partners, we pride ourselves on connecting elite talent with transformative roles in the financial sector.

• Build adaptive features that generalize across geographies, regimes, and sectors
• Work side-by-side with traders and researchers to get models into production—refine signal decay, execution pathways, and live feedback loops
• Contribute to a shared research platform that will power strategy launches across the global book

What They’re Looking For
• Minimum of 2–5+ years of experience in a quantitative research role within a leading trading firm or hedge fund
• Demonstrated success applying machine learning or deep learning to live strategies (equities preferred, but open to exceptional candidates from other asset classes)

• Build a research track record tied to meaningful PnL and gain ownership of these outcomes

You’ll be joining a small, AI-first team with a clear remit: push boundaries, ship models, and redefine what quantitative signal research looks like.

At Onyx Alpha Partners, we pride ourselves on connecting elite talent with transformative roles in the financial sector.
