The tech stack includes an ever-evolving range of systems and technologies, and our engineers have the freedom to choose the best solution for the problem at hand. If a new technology has the potential to add value, they’ll actively invest in exploring, adopting and developing it.

Quantitative Developers within the Strategy Development team primarily develop applications in Python with occasional development in Java and Typescript. They use a variety of open source frameworks for numerical analysis and distributing large workloads (Pandas, Numpy, XGBoost, Dask and Kubernetes for example). These systems connect to various data access and persistence technologies such as S3, MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB, Hadoop and Kafka.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT

No two projects or any two days are the same. You can expect a dynamic, fast-paced environment that delivers a steady stream of challenges. One of the most exciting aspects of the job is our quick feedback loop.

They hire from the top 10% of the global tech community and they reward accordingly. Beyond this, they provide their software engineers an extensive range of training and personal development opportunities, as well as the chance to work with the latest technologies.
