LifeCheq is a personal finance fintech business operating across South Africa. Our unique approach to financial advice and our market-leading advice platform has redefined the category. Our technology touches consumers, financial advisers and large enterprise institutions.

Clojure is core to our technology, and its philosophy is foundational to how we designed our systems. We rely on easy to read and immutable data structures, pure functions, and create complexity through composition of simple grokkable pieces. We primarily use Clojure for our backends, with a mixture of ClojureScript and TypeScript for our frontends. Key technologies include event sourcing, Lacinia (GraphQL), re-frame and sci.

Our business is funded by reputable institutional investors including Naspers, Futuregrowth and African Rainbow Capital, that believe in our mission: to help people make better financial decisions about their lives.
How you’ll grow in this role
• You will work in a cross functional squad, along with non-Clojure engineers, financial experts, designers and product people. Each squad with a clear focus on a set of customer related goals and outcomes, and autonomy in how to best realise that. With great autonomy comes great responsibility.
• Personal financial advice is one of the toughest business domains to crack: it will flex your design and coding skills, it will challenge how you test, integrate and deploy.
• As we continue growing, contribute to how we architect, deploy and monitor our systems.
• Learn with our 13 people strong Clojure team, that has an average of 14 years of experience;
• We’re scaling our operations significantly: grow with the company, and choose your technical or management path.

What skills you’ll bring
• Minimum 3 years of professional software development experience, fluency in core Clojure/ClojureScript;
• Flexibility across frontend/backend is a big plus, but specialisation in either is also welcome;
• Energy, joy, curiosity.
• This is a full-time, remote position.
