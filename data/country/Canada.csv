• You’re courageous. In a rapidly changing industry like ours, you’re not afraid to voice your ideas, and challenge the status quo. You have the confidence to tackle difficult problems and the resilience to see them through.

• You steer clear of performative crypto trends. You’re mission-driven, focused on substance and prefer actions that drive real results over following popular narratives.

Who you are:
• Strong background in quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, or market microstructure
• Comfort working close to code (Python, Rust, or similar), enough to prototype or review logic
• Experience with DeFi protocols, centralised exchanges, or on-chain trading bots
• A hacker mindset; you think like an adversary to spot risks before they become problems
• Curiosity, ownership, and a bias toward action

Description

I hope this message finds you well. I'm in need of a robust and adaptable algorithm for day trading the NASDAQ 100 indices on MetaTrader 4 and 5. I'm looking for a single-market trend-following system with the following specifications :

Market : NASDAQ 100 indices

Timeframes : 5-minute, 1-minute

Entry : Trades initiated at order blocks

Exit : Trades closed upon reaching a Fibonacci target

Compounding : Winning trades compound, with a limit of two consecutive wins before resetting to the original risk per position of 0.50 percent

Risk Management : Maximum daily loss capped at 2.5 percent

Stop Loss : ATR-based stop losses at order block entries, ranging from 1 to 2 times the ATR

I'm looking for an algorithm that is simple yet adjustable, allowing for easy parameter modifications. Additionally, I'm interested in expanding its functionality to trade FX, commodities, and cryptocurrencies while maintaining the same parameters.

Could you provide insights on any additional features or considerations that could enhance the algorithm's performance? Also, I'd appreciate an estimate of the time required for initial development, ongoing maintenance, and the feasibility of extending its capabilities to other markets.

Looking forward to your insights and potential collaboration on this project.

Knowledge about cloud computing (AWS), systems engineering, distributed systems, scripting, operating systems (specifically Windows and Linux), databases, and host-based networking, is useful in this role. Upfront knowledge is preferred, but not required; if you are passionate about technology, learning new concepts is natural and fun.
• Collaborative Communication – we work together with many different teams and stakeholders. You have a collaborative spirit that helps you to work well with others and communicate effectively.
• Project Ownership Mindset – we own different technology stacks and are often responsible for exploring new technology to modernize existing systems. Our team needs to take initiative and proactively drive the execution of systems projects that we own. You enjoy taking on responsibility and owning decisions made. Organizational skills are helpful to ensure projects are well managed.

"Portfolio Manager & Co-Head of Global Market Implementation, Quantitative Equities",B. Riley Farber Executive Search,"Vancouver, BC, Canada",Jobs,,['Full-time'],"Our client, Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management Ltd. (“CC&LIM”), is a privately owned global institutional money manager with an AUM of USD $53 billion. Founded in 1982, CC&LIM has been successfully managing a broad range of investment solutions that span traditional asset classes, such as global equities and fixed income and balanced, as well as alternative strategies, such as portable alpha, market neutral and absolute return strategies. With USD $28 billion in AUM, CC&LIM’s Quantitative Equity team manages just over half of the firm’s overall assets.

CC&L is owned by the current leaders of the organization. The team prioritizes succession planning and actively transitions equity ownership from generation to generation.

CC&LIM is based in beautiful Vancouver, Canada. The CC&LIM team embraces the lifestyle and activities that life in Vancouver awards.

CC&LIM’s Global Quantitative Equities team (“Q Team”)

CC&LIM’s Quantitative Equities team has been managing quantitative equity portfolios for over two decades. The team’s strong growth and investment performance across their strategies can be attributed to several factors. Most notably, their culture of embracing curiosity, creativity, technology, innovation, and growth and recognizing the value of collaboration and diverse thought.

The Q team’s investment philosophy centers around creating unique and innovative insights in the marketplace over both the near and long-term; all their insights are developed in house and the majority are uncorrelated to traditional quantitative style factors. The team prioritizes alpha generation over asset acquisition.

The Global Market Implementation Team

The Quantitative Market Implementation team is part of the Q team’s portfolio management function. Portfolio Management for their Q portfolios consists of two underlying functions: 1) the construction of optimal portfolios and desired trades for those portfolios, and 2) the implementation of those desired portfolios in the global markets in which they trade.

The leadership of the Global Market Implementation function is responsible for the strategy, execution and oversight of the implementation of their systematically driven portfolios in the market. This includes responsibility for their trade execution strategy in each of approximately 50 global equity markets, as well as responsibility for their stock borrow relationships, portfolio financing and leverage, FX trading, and strategic management of their overall trading and prime-brokerage dealer relationships.

The Co-Head of Global Market Implementation

The Co-Head of Global Market Implementation is an important investment leadership role within the Q Team. The successful candidate will be responsible for enacting their contributions in the trading and prime brokerage areas, managing 5-10 direct reports. The successful candidate, therefore, will bring leadership expertise from a quantitative equities background with expertise specifically in trading and / or prime brokerage.

The successful candidate will elevate the Global Market Implementation team and everyone around them by embodying a spirit of innovation in quantitatively driven asset management, aligned with CC&LIM’s cultural principles, in everything they do. They will make a combination of meaningful contributions by attracting, retaining and developing exceptional talent, generating novel ideas for systematically driven trade execution and prime brokerage strategy, and contributing other ideas to drive exceptional investment performance and client services.

The successful individual in this role will be required to bring forward ideas that will be materially impactful to the business over short and long-term horizons. Financial markets and the quantitative investment landscape are constantly evolving, so it’s imperative that the team is continuously developing the next generation of ideas.

Responsibilities:
• Providing thought leadership at a strategic level for global portfolio implementation – bringing creative insights from a market perspective and working with CC&L’s existing head of trading and head of prime brokerage to push forward new ideas for expanding the team’s implementation capabilities.
• Contributing to idea generation within the greater Q Team. For example, introducing and contributing to new investment opportunities that are becoming available through data, specifically related to trading and prime brokerage.
• Applying strategic relationship management practices to our suite of dealer and counterparty relationships, including strategic contractual term negotiation, fee and service level management and commission wallet optimization.
• Assuming accountability for the team responsible for the implementation of trades – implementing and affecting these trades in the market, as well as overseeing trading research – continually conducting research and tests that drive our optimal venue selection and trading algorithms.
• Assuming accountability for the team responsible for managing our Prime Brokerage counter-parties – interfacing with the dealers on optimal strategies for our stock borrow, margin and portfolio financing needs, contributing to, and overseeing our internal research into systematic methods for optimizing these, and the negotiations and monitoring around this for our portfolios.

Personal Attributes & Qualifications:
• A minimum of 7 years of quantitative equities experience with a background in the implementation of global equity portfolios.
• Leadership - demonstrates outstanding leadership and mentoring capabilities.
• Systematic mindset – passionate about bringing systematization and a disciplined structure together with investment intuition. Experience guiding quantitative analysis and research initiatives.

• Strong communication – excel at communicating complex and technical concepts.
• Demonstrated learner – ability to develop a strong understanding of the Q Team’s quantitative investment models and systematic investment process.

· Implement metrics and reporting dashboards for monitoring of the effectiveness of the MRM framework.

· Analyze the metrics results and breach management: Liaise with the first line of defense and the validation teams in the management reporting on the model risk evolution and remediation actions. Provide input to MRM and other stakeholders committees.

· Conduct Quality Control: Perform checks on independent model reviews.

• Work with fellow engineers, analysts, and developers to deliver robust and adaptable solutions aligned with business needs
• Monitor, refine, and scale systems to ensure reliability and responsiveness under growing data demands

Desired Qualifications
• 5+ years of experience in data engineering, quantitative systems, or investment technology

• Familiarity with financial data providers such as Bloomberg, FactSet, MSCI, or Capital IQ
• Exposure to or interest in AI agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI, AutoGPT) and LLM-powered tools
• Bonus: Experience with vector search, RAG pipelines, or ML infrastructure
• Progress toward the CFA designation or experience supporting investment professionals is considered an asset
• Strong communication and problem-solving skills, with the ability to work independently and collaboratively in high-performance teams

Why Mawer?
• Directly contribute to the firm’s growth as a global, independent investment manager.
• Learn and work within a high-performing team that has consistently delivered exceptional long-term investment results and high levels of client satisfaction.
• Be a part of a meritocracy in which the quality of ideas supersedes hierarchy; where every role is valued, and every voice heard. At Mawer, talented team members can progress quickly, regardless of tenure or experience.
• Our unique culture, which is integral to who we are and (we think) a competitive advantage. Our culture is shaped by our core values (integrity, putting clients’ interests first, excellence, teamwork, and long-term thinking) and key behaviours (curiosity, candour, accountability, and appreciation), which are much more than words on a page. They guide the way we operate, make decisions, and communicate every day.
• We offer a flexible work environment with a blended workplace approach tailored to the unique needs of each department and team. This allows employees to seamlessly combine in-person and remote work experiences, fostering collaboration, promoting work-life integration, and empowering our team members to thrive in a dynamic, interconnected professional setting.

Aleph is an AI-native platform for Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A). We operate in an established software category with a multi-billion market but no clear winner. Our growth has come from product velocity and customer outcomes, not marketing spend, and the results speak for themselves.

Aleph was founded by Albert Gozzi and Santiago Perez De Rosso, two technical founders with backgrounds from Stanford and MIT and experience working at top-tier companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Bain & Company. We’re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Webflow, Turo, Notion, Zapier, and many others.

What we’ve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company's financial data – think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce – and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that: Aleph is AI-native at its core, automating reporting, variance analysis, and forecasting through intelligent agents. We’re building the always-on decision layer for modern businesses.

We’re moving fast, shipping constantly, leaning into AI to make the product smarter with every release, while also applying AI to how we sell, support and scale. Our churn is low, growth is strong, and the pace keeps accelerating.

We are hiring remotely across the Americas (United States, Canada, LATAM).

We're looking for a Staff-level software engineer to join our growing engineering team. You will partner with our technical CEO, CTO, and other members of the engineering team to build critical software with an outsized impact on our users and our business.

This is an exciting opportunity for someone to come in as an early member of the team and drive the development of our platform from the ground up.

Specifically, this role sits on our Core Product team, which is responsible for our web app and add-ins. You will work on user-facing functionality that allows finance and operations teams to extract insights from their data and make better decisions.

👷 What you'll be doing
• Work hand-in-hand with leadership and other teammates to prioritize and execute on our product roadmap
• Design, develop and own complex features or software components
• Deliver robust, scalable, and well-tested code
• Help develop and establish best practices to lay the foundation for a high-performing technology team and its culture
• Collaborate with Design and Operation teams to keep making Aleph better every day

🤠 About you
• Enjoy owning a project from start to finish and loves to take on the responsibility to bring projects across the finish line
• Can navigate a fast-paced/dynamic environment and operate autonomously to get work done
• Comfortable working in a remote team
• Enjoy enabling others to do their best work. Our product is all about enabling businesses to make smarter decisions and giving the people who work at the data level, super-powers.
• Product-driven engineer. You're comfortable and eager to meet customers and develop an empathetic understanding of their problems to ensure we're building the right solutions

📝 What you have
• 8+ years of software development experience
• 3+ years of experience contributing to the system design or architecture (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new or existing systems
• Previous startup experience, or experience thriving in an unstructured environment
• Experience with a B2B SaaS product, analytics, or building tools for Finance teams
• Exposure and interest in Finance, with emphasis in FP&A

Additional notes

Our tech stack is GCP, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB and BigQuery.

While this is a remote-first opportunity, we're focusing on candidates within the Americas to better align with our working hours as a team.

Aleph is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

Maverick Currencies is Hiring

We are a top-ranked proprietary trading firm that allows traders to use our capital to increase their profits.

Maverick Currencies is looking for people with an entrepreneurial spirit and a profit-driven mindset to trade cryptocurrency and stock options on behalf of the firm. Our traders keep 70% to 80% of their profits and get to learn how to profitably trade cryptocurrency. Those with a sales background are encouraged to apply.

About the Company

You don’t need 10 years of experience at Wall Street to trade for us-our veteran traders, extensive support, and comprehensive training programs allow novices to become experts who trade serious capital. We have many successful traders with us who have sales backgrounds.

We’re different than a regular day-trading firm. We have made our name as a top swing and position-trading firm, which means we take positions that range from a few days to a few months. One benefit of this strategy is that our traders can work flexible hours, including in part-time and full-time positions. And since all the work is done over the web, traders have the option to work at-location or remotely, provided they have high-speed internet access.

Maverick Currencies is one of the oldest and most experienced prop trading firms out there, and we are ranked as one of the top trading companies in the entire industry. We have lived through multiple bear and bull cycles and understand how to profit in any financial environment. This means we are able to train our traders how to tackle even the most challenging situations. Our emphasis on risk management and mentorship keeps our traders ahead of the curve.

Our traders start out with a minimum account of $25,000 and get to bank 70% to 80% of the profits. Over time as they prove themselves, traders become eligible to trade more and more of the firm’s capital. To give you an idea, our best traders can trade up to $800,000.

Requirements

Often the best candidates have a background in business, and any experience in trading or investing is a bonus. We have many successful traders with us who have a background in sales. However, the most important characteristic for traders is a commitment to following the firm’s trading methodology and risk management guidelines that are proven to create long-term gains. It is also required that you have a strong interest in cryptocurrency.

The Application Process

We have an in-depth application process that explains what prop trading is, our training methodology, and how we support, fund, and pay our traders. These steps prepare you for your interview with our recruiters, where you can ask any remaining questions you have and discuss why you are a good fit for the position.

Click on the ‘Apply for job’ button below to start your application. You will watch a short video on Maverick Trading and its Capital Sharing Program that details how you get both funded and paid.

You’ll then fill out the rest of the application. After you submit it, one of our recruiters will contact you for an interview where they will vet your suitability for the position.

Expert traders aren’t born, they are built. And Maverick Trading can mold you into one of the best in the business.

The Crypto and Forex markets are open 23-1/2 hours a day, five days a week. This time horizon allows the firm to offer its traders flexible hours and the ability to start part-time and transition into full-time trading. Prop currency trading is a mentally engaging, challenging profession where diligence and consistency translate directly into financial rewards. In other words, this is truly meaningful work. The firm’s traders have the opportunity to practice their craft from anywhere in the world via high-speed internet.

Trading with the Firm

You don’t need 10 years of experience at Wall Street to trade for us-our veteran traders, extensive support, and comprehensive training programs allow novices to become experts who trade serious capital. Those with a legal or paralegal background are encouraged to apply, as we have many successful paralegals trading with us.

Started in 1997, Maverick Trading is one of the most experienced prop trading firms and is ranked as one of the top trading companies in the industry, accepting and funding experienced traders as well as teaching motivated people from all backgrounds how to become traders. The firm’s Maverick Currency Division has been actively trading the Currency markets since 2009. As a result of a long track record of success, the firm has the capital to back and fund its traders with meaningful amounts of capital.

Each trader starts live trading with a minimum of a $10,000 account ($500,000 in buying power) and keeps 70% to 80% of trading profits. As you gain experience and demonstrate consistent profitability you become eligible for greater amounts of the firm’s capital. Profitable traders are also eligible for Performance Bonuses.

Requirements

Often the best candidates have a background in math, finance, and business, and any experience in trading or investing is a bonus. Legal and paralegal specialists have had great success trading with us as well. However, the most important characteristic for traders is a commitment to following the firm’s trading methodology and risk management guidelines that are proven to create long-term gains.

We look forward to speaking with you and exploring if you’ll be the next great trader to join us.

Based on prior experience and possession of trading licenses or certificates, traders may incur costs in order to trade within the firm. All trading activity also requires fees for data feeds, commissions and trading spreads, which each trader will be responsible for. Once a trader establishes a track record of consistent profitability, the firm will cover these costs on behalf of the trader.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJSZW1vdGUgRW50cnkgTGV2ZWwgQ3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kgVHJhZGluZyBKb2IgaW4gR2VyYWxkdG9uLCBPTiB8IEZ1bGwgVGltZSIsImNvbXBhbnlfbmFtZSI6Ik1hdmVyaWNrIEN1cnJlbmNpZXMiLCJhZGRyZXNzX2NpdHkiOiJDYW5hZGEiLCJodGlkb2NpZCI6ImQtQ09Kd2V4Mkw1NGpnSzlBQUFBQUE9PSIsInV1bGUiOiJ3K0NBSVFJQ0lHUTJGdVlXUmgiLCJnbCI6InVzIiwiaGwiOiJlbiJ9,,Full-time and Part-time,,,2025-06-17 12:17:21.339353,Trader,Canada,https://www.google.com/search?ibp=htl;jobs&q=Trader&htidocid=d-COJwex2L54jgK9AAAAAA%3D%3D&hl=en-US&shndl=37&shmd=H4sIAAAAAAAA_yXOuwrCQBBAUWzzCYIwtWgigo2WQQXxAZJeJpshWd3shNlJSMB_89d8Nbc6xY1eowivVLMSbL3KAEfqyEEqQ6NsWhHyZoBMsLC-hAPnYD3sSdAVyn4GlzM8Ydc6B5mtCeY_EgjFVMAfyVw6Gm8q1SaskyQEF5dBUa2JDdcJe8q5T-6ch29uoUKhxqHSbbla9HHjy-nkhB2JNQ9I_z-WwvciRY8FvgHooCRswgAAAA&shmds=v1_AdeF8KhJAFlk3nxEE7WKhHm2nEMJQwYCUHZD06wCgkat0xUNLQ&source=sh/x/job/li/m1/1#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=Trader&htidocid=d-COJwex2L54jgK9AAAAAA%3D%3D,"[{'title': 'Maverick Currencies', 'link': 'https://maverickcurrencies.com/job/remote-entry-level-cryptocurrency-trading-job-in-geraldton-on-full-time/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic'}, {'title': 'Clever Hiring', 'link': 'https://cleverhiring.com/j/7RTOCZcB_CyF9o_0_kJa0525?i=81cf5cc59b894a7c84d72b8822924b46&utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic'}]",No degree mentioned

About the Role

There's a role for everyone in retail - including leadership. As a Trading Manager, you'll motivate your Section Managers to deliver the best standards across your department, maximising availability and driving sales. You'll have an eye for detail, maintaining shop floor standards and coaching your team to do the same. You'll be responsible for ensuring that merchandising and operational standards are met, and that back of house areas run safely and smoothly. If you're looking for a chance to develop further in retail, this could be the role for you!

As part of the leadership team, you'll work a three-week rolling rota which will include weekends, evenings and sometimes late nights. At times, you may be solely responsible for the store, and therefore you'll need to be confident in overseeing operation as a whole.

You'll have an enthusiastic approach and be a strong coach, mentor and motivator. You'll be a role model to the colleagues around you, ensuring customers have a great shopping experience.

Our mission is to help our clients grow by finding new customers who look and act like their best current ones. Our proprietary in-house platform flips the traditional media model, enabling clients to learn first and test smarter, instead of spending blindly.

What Clue delivers isn’t just insights—it’s results. Our goal is to build exceptional campaigns that move real people from prospects to loyal customers of the brands we proudly service.

The Opportunity

Reporting to the COO, you’ll oversee a portfolio of clients, serving as the hands-on campaign mastermind.

You’ll work hand in hand with customer services, media strategy, and data analytics teams, leveraging our proprietary Clue Pixel technology to design innovative prospecting campaigns grounded in a brand’s first-party data.

Your success will be measured by your ability to drive incremental growth for your brand portfolio and by how effectively your campaign structure enables the strategy and analytics teams to define and evolve the ideal customer profile.

• Identify portfolio growth opportunities such as new media channels and audience tactics grounded in insight from the brand's 1st and 2nd party data.
• Troubleshoot campaigns with ad ops and ensure customers feel secure that we are managing their investment diligently.

Required Skills and Experience
• 3+ years of hands-on experience managing programmatic and Meta campaigns
• Must have 3+ years of experience in The Trade Desk, DV360, and Meta Ads and be able to demonstrate capabilities in a practical testing environment
• Strong analytical skills and reasoning. We are looking for candidates who can both structure campaigns to meet performance targets but also design campaigns to teach brands something new about their prospects.
• Detail-oriented with an intense pride in your work. We’re looking for candidates who thoughtfully name each ad group with the end user in mind, specifically how it will appear in shared reporting tools like Looker.
• An exceptional team player looking to learn. Clue Digital employs a scientific approach to each campaign. Our best traders come into each brand with an open mind, ready to collaborate.

Preferred Qualifications
• 3+ years managing performance campaigns with KPIs like CPA, iCPA, ROAS, and iROAS
• Hands-on experience in Amazon DSP, Linked In, and Tik Tok, in addition to the platforms listed above.
