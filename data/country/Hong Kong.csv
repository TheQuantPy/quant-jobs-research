You’ll also be able to access our physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and hopefully get a real sense of what it would be like to work here full time.

If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company—many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative nature, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.

About the Position

As a Quantitative Research intern, you’ll work side by side with full-timers to learn how we identify market signals, analyze large datasets, build and test models, create new strategies, and write code to implement them.

The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers—and they often require insights from colleagues across the firm with different areas of expertise. During the program you’ll work on two projects, mentored closely by the full-time employees who designed them. Some projects consider big-picture questions that we’re still trying to figure out, while others involve building new tools or systems.

Your mentors will work in two distinct areas of research, so you’ll gain a better understanding of the diverse array of research challenges we consider every day, from reasoning about how best to analyze very noisy datasets to building practical models that allow us to better identify market signals. Your day-to-day project work will be complemented by classes on the broader fundamentals of markets and trading, lunch seminars, and real-time discussion on the desk.

If you’d like to learn more, you can read about our interview process and meet some of our newest hires.

About You

We don’t expect you to have a background in finance or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:
• Able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems
• Intellectually curious—asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers
• A strong programmer who is interested in learning to write code in OCaml, even if you’ve never done functional programming before
• An open-minded thinker and precise communicator who enjoys interacting with colleagues from a wide range of professional backgrounds and areas of expertise
• Eager to ask questions, admit mistakes, and learn new things
• Fluent in English",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJRdWFudGl0YXRpdmUgUmVzZWFyY2hlciAtIFN1bW1lciBJbnRlcm5zaGlwIiwiY29tcGFueV9uYW1lIjoiSmFuZSBTdHJlZXQiLCJhZGRyZXNzX2NpdHkiOiJIb25nIEtvbmciLCJodGlkb2NpZCI6IjF4b3IzVnhRYnVpaFFyc2JBQUFBQUE9PSIsInV1bGUiOiJ3K0NBSVFJQ0lKU0c5dVp5QkxiMjVuIiwiZ2wiOiJ1cyIsImhsIjoiZW4ifQ==,9 days ago,Internship,,2025-06-17 12:22:42.774904,Quantitative Researcher,Hong Kong,

That's the key question. Even more important now as Trump global trade wars are raging.

'It's not the plane, but the pilot' Top Gun 2. If you 'Think Different', look far ahead and believe in being adaptable, this may be the place for you. Successful disruptors believe: It's the ""fight"" in the dog not the ""size"" of the dog that matters.

The long run upside is exponential while downside is limited. No free lunch in the world, time is limited, pursue your passion and be handsomely rewarded, not just monetary wise but also get a sense of total achievement - express your creative ideas and be fairly rewarded with a great performance bonus.

This is a SFC Type 9 licensed Asset Management RO role but we can consider those from discretionary private client accounts with min. 2 years experience in fund management, family office, private banking, PE or IR experience.

Our focus is on getting the ""Job to be done"" for investors - a truly challenging & rewarding task to attain 'consistent lower risk' long-term performance via innovation and agility.

Strive to be best of best, don't take orders from top with little common sense for clients or integrity of the job: someone thinks like a scientist, doctor, architect but act with unbridled creativity like an artist, designer, musician - ""Art + Science doer"".

Humble and hungry for success yet take failure with stride to rise above it all for yourself & for team and for clients, always. Customer-centric is what makes firms great not making top dollar for the firm first.

Not the What. Those looking for a high 'basic pay' job like big brand names instead of ""performance driven"" compensation - Do Not Apply. (We seek talents in the 5% not the 95% majority.)

Willing to be contrarian and challenge the status quo. Warren Buffett said once about Benjamin Graham his guru – ‘he believed that the markets are wrong’ – this totally run contrary to what many market analysts or economists believe the market is priced in and cannot make excess gain (efficient market hypothesis). Macro hedge fund managers like George Soros & Jim Rogers also held the same view and Sir John Templeton a value investor was agile to short-sell tech stocks when 2000 dotcom bubble burst going against Wall St consensus.

Thus, we seek someone HIP, 'unconventional / rebel' from an organization with courage to seek a refreshing change. High confidence, don't accept no for an answer to get the best results for clients; challenge the status quo, good knowledge of financial markets (always learning & questioning) and courage & perspective to be a pragmatic risk-taker. An 'artisan' that never gives up.

If you can bring value to the table - with both skills and ""network"", let's talk for larger ""total package - including % performance bonus"" that can be 2x bonus of big firms.

Yes, we seek ""hidden gems"" that may or may not have 'Ivy League or pedigree backgrounds or connections', but a strong desire to work hard & innovate to win, even stronger desire to stand up after falling. Even the underdog can do well if given a chance. The sky is the limit if you truly believe in resilience.

Resourceful with a good network of existing corporate/HNWI clients (a plus) or know how to find & build. A strategic mindset to drive the future success of the client and our firm under one vision. The ability to persuade adoption of new ideas to capture emerging trends i.e ESG / Sustainability is ""in the investment process"" as climate change

For junior roles, please email your CV, basic pay & why/how you can add value to: [via CTgoodjobs Apply Now]

Rewards
• The total package is of high personal enrichment for the suitable candidate over time
• Getting licensed in HK as SFC type 9 (Asset Management) representative or RO (depends on experience) and potentially U.S and Cayman - highly transferable skills to institutional pension or large asset managers
• Highest ""profit-sharing/performance bonus"" model in the industry with a transparent formula, high degree of autonomy and discretion in managing funds with an 'own business' mindset.
• Potential exponential growth with institutional investors in future after 2-3 years track record
• We are able to value add to candidates with the desire to improve and learn with our in-house training
• Suitable candidates may be offered an unprecedented chance to be a minority equity holder to grow
• Fast progress based on results: build your own team in future - direct that business in a flat meritocratic system
• Work hours may be 'partially flexible' as we stress ""quality over quantity"" - ""great ideas over stale copycat ideas"" & tactically executing the ""best work at the right time-right place"").
• Chance to collaborate in future fintech and social innovation/ESG/IPO bespoke projects
• Sponsorship of future courses and travel relevant to the job

Responsibilities
• Create 'consistent' risk-adjusted returns for clients of 8-15% net p.a (not super high but volatile returns)
• Implement a strong risk management 'low risk-low vol' strategy
• Manage and grow client base of Asian/global institutions, listed companies, UHNWI, non-profit etc
• Communicate to client ideas and market updates with strong conviction i.e Hedge fund, ESG, AI

• Able to help manage client portfolio in bull and bear markets (run net long or net short portfolios)
• Flexible and adapt fast to suit evolving market/economic conditions
• Adapt and learn fast in US, European and Asian markets (at times US time zone may be needed)
• Use excellent risk management skills to limit losses and preserve capital
• Execute a mid-long term strategic growth plan to outperform the market i.e seek alpha returns
• Maintain good teamwork with the firm's culture of innovation, transparency and dedication (Core Values: HIP-AIR)
• Look at P&L and forecast financial metrics as performance matters to clients

We don’t work in siloes and our environment is overly collaborative. You’ll be able to see your fundamentals research translate directly into real trades that are made every day.

About You
