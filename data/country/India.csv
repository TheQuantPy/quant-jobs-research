If the team fails, everyone fails, so prioritize and execute.
We think long-term, set big goals, and communicate with clear directions and goals to achieve them. Everyone must understand not just what they're doing but also why they are doing it.
No Egos, lead by example, and mutual accountability.
Strive for clear and simple communication - this is easier said than done but communicating the ""why"" of an issue is equally important as the ""what.
All meetings have an agenda, with outcomes clearly defined as tasks and call-to-actions.
Prioritize all tasks by - what is more important for our users without compromising on any of the above goals.

Values & How we work

The entire crypto space doesn't just move fast but is constantly accelerating. Its hard building a DeFi product its 24/7, 365 days a year, markets do not close, the ground beneath you can shift, assumptions can and do fail & risk of burning out is real.
We take our product + brand very seriously.
If we see even a small flaw in our product, we always ask ourselves - Why isn't this perfect
All members have perpetual autonomy to fix anything broken that we notice, and we do not wait for someone else to tell us what to do.
Take extreme ownership of everything we do
If the team fails, everyone fails, so prioritize and execute.
We think long-term, set big goals, and communicate with clear directions and goals to achieve them. Everyone must understand not just what they're doing but also why they are doing it.
No Egos, lead by example, and mutual accountability.
Strive for clear and simple communication - this is easier said than done but communicating the ""why"" of an issue is equally important as the ""what.
All meetings have an agenda, with outcomes clearly defined as tasks and call-to-actions.
Prioritize all tasks by - what is more important for our users without compromising on any of the above goals.

What we offer
Unique opportunity to work with a small, focused & ambitious team on very interesting projects and get the level of responsibility and ownership that would be unlikely at any other project.
Great company culture: informal, non-hierarchical, ambitious, highly professional yet collaborative and entrepreneurial
Sense of a Shared Mission
Work on the latest technology, equipment, and web3 stack with dedicated budgets
Flexible working hours

Company: 39k Group – India’s Largest Crypto Trading Firm

About 39k

39k Group is India’s largest crypto trading firm, running high-frequency strategies across centralized and OTC venues globally. We combine deep market knowledge with low-latency infrastructure to provide continuous liquidity in digital assets — 24/7, around the world.

Role Overview

We’re hiring a Market Maker to join our algorithmic trading team. This is a hands-on role for someone who is fluent in code, comfortable with risk, and deeply curious about how markets move. You’ll be responsible for managing automated quoting strategies, optimizing inventory and risk, and directly contributing to PnL.

What You’ll Do
• Manage live market making strategies across one or more crypto venues
• Tune pricing, quoting frequency, and skew parameters based on market conditions
• Collaborate with quant and infra teams to improve latency, signal quality, and edge
• Monitor risk metrics in real time — inventory, exposure, volatility, and slippage
• Use Python, C++, or Rust to write and modify production trading logic
• Analyze post-trade data to refine strategy performance and execution behavior
• Think clearly under pressure — especially during volatile or stressed market conditions

What We’re Looking For
• 2–3 years of experience in algo trading, HFT, or systematic market making
• Strong programming ability in Python and/or C++/Rust
• Solid grasp of market microstructure, bid-offer dynamics, and execution strategies
• Understanding of risk-adjusted returns, portfolio exposure, and hedging
• Clear logical thinking, strong quantitative skills, and good intuition for probability
• Comfortable working in a 24/7 market environment — with shared ownership and on-call rotation
• Bonus: Experience with crypto markets, DeFi protocols, or cross-exchange arbitrage

Why Join 39k?
• Run real strategies with live PnL ownership from Day 1
• Work with a collaborative team of traders, quants, and engineers — no silos
• Operate across the global crypto ecosystem: CEXs, RFQs, and OTC
• Contribute to the firm’s core performance — and grow as a decision-maker, not just a coder
• Hybrid work setup with performance-linked compensation and rapid decision cycles

If you’re an independent thinker who thrives in code, risk, and real-time markets — and you want to make every trade count — we’d love to talk.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJDcnlwdG8gTWFya2V0IE1ha2VyIiwiY29tcGFueV9uYW1lIjoiMzlrIEdyb3VwIiwiYWRkcmVzc19jaXR5IjoiR3VydWdyYW0sIEhhcnlhbmEsIEluZGlhIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiJrMUVabHVPQTdibFR3S0tuQUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJRlNXNWthV0UiLCJnbCI6InVzIiwiaGwiOiJlbiJ9,https://serpapi.com/searches/685151c250d43e4e69bc1814/images/e48c343d0a9c3912478ebf853dd3c67702669034759b5bb92d79bfb9b2da8742.gif,5 days ago,Full-time,,2025-06-17 13:30:11.277166,Quantitative Trader,India,

Location: Gurgaon

Company: 39k Group – India’s Largest Crypto Trading Firm

About 39k

39k Group is India’s largest crypto trading firm, running high-frequency strategies across centralized and OTC venues globally. We combine deep market knowledge with low-latency infrastructure to provide continuous liquidity in digital assets — 24/7, around the world.

Role Overview

We’re hiring a Market Maker to join our algorithmic trading team. This is a hands-on role for someone who is fluent in code, comfortable with risk, and deeply curious about how markets move. You’ll be responsible for managing automated quoting strategies, optimizing inventory and risk, and directly contributing to PnL.

What You’ll Do
• Manage live market making strategies across one or more crypto venues
• Tune pricing, quoting frequency, and skew parameters based on market conditions
• Collaborate with quant and infra teams to improve latency, signal quality, and edge
• Monitor risk metrics in real time — inventory, exposure, volatility, and slippage
• Use Python, C++, or Rust to write and modify production trading logic
• Analyze post-trade data to refine strategy performance and execution behavior
• Think clearly under pressure — especially during volatile or stressed market conditions

What We’re Looking For
• 2–3 years of experience in algo trading, HFT, or systematic market making
• Strong programming ability in Python and/or C++/Rust
• Solid grasp of market microstructure, bid-offer dynamics, and execution strategies
• Understanding of risk-adjusted returns, portfolio exposure, and hedging
• Clear logical thinking, strong quantitative skills, and good intuition for probability
• Comfortable working in a 24/7 market environment — with shared ownership and on-call rotation
• Bonus: Experience with crypto markets, DeFi protocols, or cross-exchange arbitrage

Why Join 39k?
• Run real strategies with live PnL ownership from Day 1
• Work with a collaborative team of traders, quants, and engineers — no silos
• Operate across the global crypto ecosystem: CEXs, RFQs, and OTC
• Contribute to the firm’s core performance — and grow as a decision-maker, not just a coder
• Hybrid work setup with performance-linked compensation and rapid decision cycles

If you’re an independent thinker who thrives in code, risk, and real-time markets — and you want to make every trade count — we’d love to talk.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJDcnlwdG8gTWFya2V0IE1ha2VyIiwiY29tcGFueV9uYW1lIjoiMzlrIEdyb3VwIiwiYWRkcmVzc19jaXR5IjoiR3VydWdyYW0sIEhhcnlhbmEsIEluZGlhIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiJrMUVabHVPQTdibFR3S0tuQUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJRlNXNWthV0UiLCJnbCI6InVzIiwiaGwiOiJlbiJ9,https://serpapi.com/searches/685151d004e10a7057edd56e/images/6c0a3557d1e2dd3df5e57f5000da7b7644de90c5a02d6ea96cd52860b102cbd2.gif,5 days ago,Full-time,,2025-06-17 13:30:25.715232,Algorithmic Trader,India,

The entire crypto space doesn't just move fast but is constantly accelerating. Its hard building a DeFi product its 24/7, 365 days a year, markets do not close, the ground beneath you can shift, assumptions can and do fail & risk of burning out is real.
We take our product + brand very seriously.
If we see even a small flaw in our product, we always ask ourselves - Why isn't this perfect
All members have perpetual autonomy to fix anything broken that we notice, and we do not wait for someone else to tell us what to do.
Take extreme ownership of everything we do
If the team fails, everyone fails, so prioritize and execute.
We think long-term, set big goals, and communicate with clear directions and goals to achieve them. Everyone must understand not just what they're doing but also why they are doing it.
No Egos, lead by example, and mutual accountability.
Strive for clear and simple communication - this is easier said than done but communicating the ""why"" of an issue is equally important as the ""what.
All meetings have an agenda, with outcomes clearly defined as tasks and call-to-actions.
Prioritize all tasks by - what is more important for our users without compromising on any of the above goals.

What we offer
Unique opportunity to work with a small, focused & ambitious team on very interesting projects and get the level of responsibility and ownership that would be unlikely at any other project.
Great company culture: informal, non-hierarchical, ambitious, highly professional yet collaborative and entrepreneurial

Who We Are

Single Security Pricing (SSP) is a small, close-knit team with a collegiate culture that values openness, creativity and an attention to detail bordering on the fanatical. We are also huge nerds.

What You Will Be Doing
• Researching on the availability, quality, and liquidity of the market data from different providers.
• Designing and implementing the processes of loading and digesting the market data required for the analytics in Aladdin.
• Designing, implementing, and maintaining the orchestration of inter-dependent jobs performing loading and further flow of the data through various analytical processes in Aladdin.
• Designing, implementing, and maintaining the processes for QC-ing the data (both the raw market input as well as the derived analytics), model surveillance, and performance monitoring.
• Maintaining the framework of the jobs which load and process the data; investigating the issues / errors / thresholds breaking etc.; appropriate reaction to the failure-indicating events.
• Thought Leadership: Keep abreast of recent trends in technology, quantitative finance, capital markets and regulation. Bring the latest techniques to bear on the problems we face in our day-to-day work.

What We Look For
• A Degree in a Quantitative Field: An undergraduate degree is required. An advanced degree is a plus, but mathematical maturity matters far more than formal qualifications.
• A Passion for Programming: Programming is at the heart of everything we do. You must enjoy it to succeed on this team.
• Exposure to an “industrial strength” Programming Language: While C++ is our language of choice, experience with writing performant code is what we’re really after.
• An Analytical Cast of Mind: Whether you have a PhD in Physics or merely read math books for fun (we have both types on the team), a keen interest in solving analytical problems is key.
• Excellent Communication Skills: You will be expected to explain complex concepts to non-technical people in simple, intuitive terms.
• A Sense of Humor: We don’t take ourselves too seriously, and hopefully neither do you.

The entire crypto space doesn't just move fast but is constantly accelerating. Its hard building a DeFi product its 24/7, 365 days a year, markets do not close, the ground beneath you can shift, assumptions can and do fail & risk of burning out is real.
We take our product + brand very seriously.
If we see even a small flaw in our product, we always ask ourselves - Why isn't this perfect
All members have perpetual autonomy to fix anything broken that we notice, and we do not wait for someone else to tell us what to do.
Take extreme ownership of everything we do
If the team fails, everyone fails, so prioritize and execute.
We think long-term, set big goals, and communicate with clear directions and goals to achieve them. Everyone must understand not just what they're doing but also why they are doing it.
No Egos, lead by example, and mutual accountability.
Strive for clear and simple communication - this is easier said than done but communicating the ""why"" of an issue is equally important as the ""what.
All meetings have an agenda, with outcomes clearly defined as tasks and call-to-actions.
Prioritize all tasks by - what is more important for our users without compromising on any of the above goals.

What we offer
Unique opportunity to work with a small, focused & ambitious team on very interesting projects and get the level of responsibility and ownership that would be unlikely at any other project.
Great company culture: informal, non-hierarchical, ambitious, highly professional yet collaborative and entrepreneurial
Sense of a Shared Mission
