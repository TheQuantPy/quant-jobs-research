You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJEaXJlY3RvciwgUXVhbnRpdGF0aXZlIFJlc2VhcmNoIFx1MDAyNiBTY2hvb2wgSW5zcGVjdGlvbiAoQmlsaW5ndWFsIEZyZW5jaCBcdTAwMjYgRW5nbGlzaCkgYXQgTmV3R2xvYmUiLCJjb21wYW55X25hbWUiOiJOZXdHbG9iZSIsImFkZHJlc3NfY2l0eSI6Ik5haXJvYmksIEtlbnlhIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiJYckJGY0ZTSGNyYmM4TU0xQUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJRlMyVnVlV0UiLCJnbCI6InVzIiwiaGwiOiJlbiJ9,,"KES 3,733–KES 93,343 a month",Full-time,,2025-06-17 13:40:21.481366,Quantitative Researcher,Kenya,

• You will work in a cross functional squad, along with non-Clojure engineers, financial experts, designers and product people. Each squad with a clear focus on a set of customer related goals and outcomes, and autonomy in how to best realise that. With great autonomy comes great responsibility.
• Personal financial advice is one of the toughest business domains to crack: it will flex your design and coding skills, it will challenge how you test, integrate and deploy.
• As we continue growing, contribute to how we architect, deploy and monitor our systems.
• Learn with our 13 people strong Clojure team, that has an average of 14 years of experience;
